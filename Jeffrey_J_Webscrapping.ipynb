            "Review 1: Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!\n",

            "Review 2: This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 3: I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.\n",

            "Review 4: Toy Story – 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway.\n",

            "Review 5: Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.\n",

            "Review 6: \"I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified.\" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the \"real world of toys\".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the \"chosen ones\", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. \"Nirvana is coming!\" the aliens whisper, watching as the \"chosen ones\" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is \"just an ordinary toy\" who \"can not fly\". \"Flying\" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the \"flesh\" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become \"something more\".Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. \"I am not a toy!\" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (\"Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?\").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not \"up in the skies\". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the \"greater good of his family\" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the \"moral code\" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: \"To Infinity and Beyond!\" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, \"Toy Story\" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since \"Snow White\".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, \"The Incredibles\". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.\n",

            "Review 7: Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking! In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels  in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature  just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz  who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.\n",

            "Review 8: What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.\n",

            "Review 9: With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. \"Toy Story\" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence.How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history.I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think \"Toy Story\". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then.Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, \"Toy Story\" is that proof. 10/10.\n",

            "Review 10: This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors. Great comedies are hard to come by - Toy Story strikes gold on that basis alone, but is so much more. One of the Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time, and currently resides on my \"Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films (1960-Present)\" list.\n",

            "Review 11: Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.\n",
            "Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs  note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.\n",
            "Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.\n",

            "Review 14: I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters.With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD.\n",

            "Review 15: I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that \"Toy Story\" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of \"Toy Story's\" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new \"it\" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit \"Finding Nemo\" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, \"Toy Story\" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love \"Toy Story,\" and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.10/10\n",

            "Review 16: The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike.\n",

            "Review 17: Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.\"Toy Story\" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when \"Toy Story\" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that \"Kelly's Heroes\" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines (\"I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school\"), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated \"Galaxy Quest.\"While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. \"A Bug's Life\" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, \"Toy Story\" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of \"the claw.\" If it reached for pathos a little less often, \"Toy Story\" would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones.\n",

Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank.\n",

            "Review 19: Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.\n",

            "Review 20: Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (\"I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout\"). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox.\n",

            "Review 21: I re-watched this for the first time in about 15 years and it still holds up remarkably well. The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting. It even tugs at the heartstrings not matter how cynical you are. It is far from Pixar's best but it holds its own in the pantheon of animated films.\n",

            "Review 22: Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song \"You've Got a Friend in Me.\" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie.But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney.Grade B+\n",

It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner.

            "Review 1: Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!\n",

            "Review 2: The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children's book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die!Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter  I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.\n",

Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy \"Jumanji\". It's a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it 'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You'll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I'd highly recommend it for a good watch. It's just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy \"Jumanji\"! 8/10\n",

Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada.

Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90's.

It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can't dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.Oh and one more thing: from \"Jumanji\", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.\n",

The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 7: I watched this classic in 2021 for the first time. Trust me, I never felt like old boring stuff. It was truly amazing. Nor, after watching the Jumanji movies till now except for this, did I find this one to be similar. It was different. It was Classical. It was a great show. Fantastical Fantasy. Good adventure although latest ones have lot more. However, this, suprised me considering I had made up my mind of what Jumanji could be. But this was truly amazing. Although latest ones have great cast, next level VFX, astounding adventure, this one's the best. I do love the first part of the latest ones that came in 2017, I'd find rather take a tie between the two than selecting one. Thank you. However, lemme tell you, it was leaving Prime, so I watched and it was worth it.\n",

            "Review 8: I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was.The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done.This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.\n",

            "Review 9: In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan's token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished.Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game's jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human.The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn't Williams' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet's Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it's a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality.This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one's fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father's approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan's father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor.Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories).Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today's techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10\n",

            "Review 10: Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good.There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid.With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him.Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him.What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film.Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.\n",

            "Review 11: There are few children's movies that I particularly enjoyed  I can recount The Borrowers, Labyrinth and The Neverending Story. Jumanji, however takes a new place among children's films  in fact, it may seem that initially, Jumanji is about simplistic story about kids playing a board game. Based on a gorgeous picture book story of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg, this movie takes a beautiful magical adventure and makes it into a thrill ride that defies all natural laws. Time travel, physical transformations, perceptual distortions and multiple universes are just a few of the things that Jumanji toys with. The most evident phenomena is that the characters run in two different and parallel universes, one where Jumanji exists, and the other where it is just a dream. The life of Judy and Peter as orphans exists in a different world from the one where Jumanji doesn't exist  in other words, Jumanji is a catalyst of fate, an evil entity that does not bring about awe as it did in Allsberg's book, but fear. The world that Allen Parrish is doomed to be incarcerated in the jungles of Jumanji is another one, but that period of time is nonexistent in the world he will eventually live in. This is the beauty of the movie; that these characters can only allow their trauma and epiphanies to cross worlds. With each roll of the dice, the characters grow and change. The ending with 'Jumanji' is mark of the end of that universe  everything that the jungle world had yielded, from the colonist-hunter Van Pelt to the roaring stampede and the monkeys had to return, to be sealed into the game and the universe. The game controls life; but it is merciful when played to the end without cheating. The mental agony and pain must have been tremendous for the Parrishes. Presumably, Alan spent his twenty six years in the jungle, but returned to his old self only to again relive his life as if it never happened. The temporal distortion must have presumably had an effect on his parents, although only Sarah seems to notice. (She was playing the game  and only those playing are directly affected, but in the game universe of Judy and Peter we see a problem in the movie's understanding of temporal change) The power of fate in deciding the endgame was critical in the film. It seems that the game was in itself a game of a game; it was all planned out and ready to go. In fact, it also seems that no matter how crazy or perilous the situation is, the characters cannot be killed. Even Van Pelt says at the Sir Sav A Lot that \"I am hunting only Alan. I won't kill you, since you didn't roll\" He too is bound to the rules of the game, no matter how much of a colonialist he is. The game instills a high level of fear without death, in order for the game to continue, all the characters must be present. So in one way, no one need be scared of anything in the game. Instead, the game builds resilience in the characters. It was natural that in the end the end was initiated by the future; or more appropriately the past. At the end, both Sarah and Alan make up for the trouble they have caused and have a life bond from the experience. The jumping between 1994 and 1964 is a critical aspect where we see that the horrors of the game have allowed Judy and Peter's parents to not die in the ski accident. They are oddly willing to put an end to their vacation when they hardly know the Parrishes\"In the jungle, you must wait, until you roll a five or eight\"  Jumanji \"Roll a two, roll a four, but never ask for more\"  GautamRATING: 10/10 (amazing)\n",

            "Review 12: I worked for several years at a bookstore. I remember when the children's book \"Jumanji\" came in. The book jacket with the reckless monkeys was very catchy. It was a very short book, so I have a feeling that some liberties were taken with the plot. There had to be a ton of extrapolation. This is a rapid fire movie which at times takes a bit of industry to keep up with. There are rules to the game and for me, they are very hard to follow. There is also a time element that is in play here. Robin Williams, as usual, plays his character to the hilt. The kids are pretty good as well. I'm sure this would appeal to a younger audience. There is no time for attention spans to expire. The computer generated graphics are wonderful, to be sure. Those monkeys are really the stars of the show.\n",

            "Review 13: This is one of those films which sort of faded into obscurity at time of release but will I believe over time be considered a classic. I have seen it over a dozen times. And, for the purposes of this review, the reason I mention that fact is to ask the obvious question... why? And the why is because of the narrative. It is nearly perfect. Heck, it may even be perfect. If you are going to create a hi-CGI fantasy about children, geared to the child within (so to speak) you need to jump down the rabbit-hole is a convincing way, so that there is no hope of return. This is the essence of every good \"fantasy\" from the beginning of time, from Peter Pan to Alice In the Looking Glass to the Matrix. Once you are in, it is hard to get out. And that hooks the audience. What better way to establish such a narrative than a kid's game with \"turns\" and \"dice\"? Where each roll gets you in deeper? Also a great chance to watch to watch Robin Williams and Dunst before he/she became too old to play these roles; and Bonnie Hunt (great!) before her film career imploded.Postscript 12/14 -- with the recent passing of Robin Williams I wanted to add the following, especially after another viewing. First, it is one of the most perfect fantasies Hollywood has done since the invention of color film (keeping in mind that the best fantasies hail from the 30s and 40s). Second, and I know his fans will not agree, possibly Williams' best work. Early in his career, and he got a chance to play a boy in a man's body. Is there a more perfect role for him?? Hunt did not have what you would call a wide or varied film career but she is pitch perfect here, and matches Williams note for note, emotion for emotion. And Kirsten Dunst, another controversial figure, seems to have had a backwards career, with her impact dwindling as she aged. The highlight of her career may have been kissing Spiderman, but her face holds the camera here in every scene she is in, and she too is pitch perfect. Massively un-appreciated, one of the greatest films in its genre ever, right up there with Harry Potter or Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast.\n",

            "Review 14: My only real complaint with Jumanji is where did this game come from? Who created it? I really wish they could have discovered more about the game's past, it's history. Then it would have made a little more sense. But I'm not saying I didn't like it. On the contrary, I do enjoy it very much, I think it's a cool buried treasure. The characters, the story, the effects all perfect. The cast does a great job in this movie and the concept of a strange magical board game works. I wish there was more monster animals. But the man eating plant and the giant spiders is enough to put it on my page. Robin Williams does great in this first monster movie, wish he do more. But that's just me. Anyway, in conclusion ladies and jelly spoons. This is an assume movie and you can do much worse then Jumanji. 8 STARS.\n",

            "Review 15: I liked Jumanji. It is way better than I thought it would be. The story starts out with the burying of a game in 1869. It is then uncovered by a boy named Alan, 100 years later. As he is playing it, he gets sucked into the game until someone rolls a 5 or an 8. That happened 26 years later. Now along with two kids and a woman who was playing the game with Alan in 1969, Alan has to finish the game despite all the creatures appearing out of the game. The special effects are amazing. They were effective and used well. The acting is decent. Robin Williams did a good job as he usually does. I did think that Hunter Van Pelt could've been more realistic. The music is pretty good. I always liked James Horner's music. There are only minor flaws here or there. I rate this movie 9/10.\n",

            "Review 16: Spoilers herein.The reason this film was made was because they could do the effects. That reason has no power now, and in fact most of them already look a bit cheezy. But there are some interesting elements:--Kirstin Dunst at her peak.--Robin Williams in his best role. Or rather for the role best suited to a manic comic.--A pretty cool house, one of the best in recent memory.--Some clever time folding.--A screenwriter's wet dream: in addition to creating a film world that sucks in viewer into an artificial reality, to have that film world contain another one. That world-within-the world is exactly as far from the normal world of the film as it is from us. Just like the film, it grabs us once we start and won't let go until the end. Clever idea.

During all these years, I re-watched it every time it came on TV (including last Wednesday) and I still love it like the very first time. And it should deserve an higher rating than 6,9.This movie has probably all the ingredients for a great family movie: safe and funny action scenes, likeable characters and suspence. The movie features also lots of CGI effects that for today's standards are a bit old, but this issue can be skipped for just enjoying the movie.Since the movie is so funny, it's very fast-paced. 100 minutes of your life pass by with sheer entertainment. You don't have to reflect on all the things that happen in the movie, because it's so funny and you'll have lots of laughs during this crazy adventure.Are there bad things in this movie? NOOOOO. In fact, one of the strongpoints of the movie is the great mix of adventure, drama and comedy. All the actors (Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Jonathan Hyde, Kirsten Dunst and David Allan Grier) give great performances and their characters are all endearing.In fact, this is one of the movies I would never get tired of re-watching, because it's so entertaining and funny. Now THIS is a family movie that can appeal to all ages and MUST be seen at least once!\n",

Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off.This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children.All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania.Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.\n",

            "Review 20: I love this movie ! Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bebe Neuwirth and the animal special effects are incredible. My only complaint is that no attempt was to explain the strange origins of the game as possibly a game that is cursed or an artifact left in our world by the African gods. There are several other plot points that are never answered: why keep returning to the house, and if they know the game is dangerous, why lose it with the pieces included so someone else can play it. I think I'd be leaving the dice and pieces as far away from each other as possible. The whole time-traveling/ renewed time line effect is a minor problem in the plot as is why that hunter wants to kill Daniel(Robin) in the first place. The computerized animal effects are made to act like real animals both charming and mischievous and sinister. The slow degradation of the Parrish house into a jungle and gradually the whole town is a remarkable effect, quite possibly the most elaborate for any movie.\n",

I had purchased the game so surprised them with it after the movie and we had a fun game night. I highly recommend it for that age. The new Jumanji is geared more towards teenagers and adults with cheesy dialogues just to generate cheap laughs; this one is a classic.

            "Review 23: Despite the revival of the title, and the pleasantly updated remakes, the 1995 version of Jumanji remains a movie I can look at when I want something fun and undemanding. While there are some problems with it, including the CGI that looked fake even back then, and some lameness in the improvised wrangling between Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, it has Williams near his peak, Kirsten Dunst during her child acting phase, Bebe Neuwirth - not enough of her - and some pleasant Peter Pan symbolism with Jonathan Hyde playing Both Williams' father and the hunter trying to kill him. In other words, there's a moral to the story that actually works.Most though, it's the good humor of the piece, alternating with the inexplicable cartoon violence, like when monkeys ravage David Alan Grier's patrol car, when vines drag it off, or when Miss Neuwirth makes her way home, only to find the house reduced to a jungle mess. Everyone works hard, the show operates almost all the time, and if it's not great cinema, it's well made cinematic junk food of the happiest sort\n",

Unfortunately, they also release a host of dangerous animals, deadly plants, and an unstoppable bloodthirsty hunter. Their only hope of survival is to finish the game, whatever the risks.Action packed, funny, heartwarming and even a little scary in places, Jumanji is an excellent family adventure for the whole family, and one that, thankfully, doesn't rely solely on its special effects to impress (a good job, since quite a bit of the CGI is looking rather dated). The story is engaging (with a nice time-travel style twist at the end), the cast is great (with Williams managing to give one of his less irritating performances), and once again director Joe Johnston delivers a final product that, whilst not a classic, is still thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.\n",

            "Review 1: Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an underground high end burglary team looking for one big last mission and a parallel story about a successful police officer who is struggling at home. As the buildup to the big heist unfolds the two worlds come closer and closer together until the ultimate collision happens.This movie is directed by Michael Mann (Ali) and stars Robert De Niro (Goodfellas), Al Pacino (Scarface), Val Kilmer (Willow), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Mykelti Williamson (Forest Gump), Ashley Judd (Kiss the Girls), Tom Sizemore (Black Hawk Down), Wes Studi (Deep Rising), Natalie Portman (Leon: The Professional), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) and Dennis Haysbert (Far from Heaven).This cast is absolutely amazing top to bottom. The writing is also excellent and delivers the backstories to each character to perfection and the dialogue is out of this world. The chemistry of the cast throughout the film worked perfectly and the action scenes are intense and very well done. You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film. The conclusion to such a huge movie is excellent and fits the film perfectly.This is an all time classic that is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.\n",

            "Review 2: I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like \"Heat\". However, on a lark and because it's apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.The biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It's almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro's oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.There's very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino's character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it's just me....Overall, if you don't mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull.\n",

            "Review 3: This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film's atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 4: I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn't disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I've heard it. It was such a \"landmark\" scene that It's even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn't just Pacino and De Niro. It's Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on. Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn't overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can't have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole.This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.\n",

            "Review 5: A brilliant character driven action thriller with drama and emotion all the way. Despite the long runtime, the pacing never drags. The Magic of this action movie is that you believe the people you see in the screen. You care for them and everything they go through. All of the scenes are influential, the script and the score are iconic. Two thumbs up!\n",

First saw this in the cinema back in 1996 and of course we all raved over how good it was but I don't think we really appreciated it back then or could have as twenty somethings.Now I'm late forties this made more sense. That obsession with something at the cost of relationships. McCauley could have been out of there a free man but something in him pulled him another way.In the bible that something comes in the guise of a serpent. That's how subtle it creeps up upon us.There's no black and white here (except for the cars). The good guys (Pacino) have a single-minded ruthless streak in them whilst the bad guys (De Niro etc) do have a heart.Great film.\n",

            "Review 7: A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent!This movie has a great plot, brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) battling Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective in this non-stop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film, he wrote the screenplay, produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series, Manhunter and Collateral.This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors and great stunts. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro).Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the \"High Incident Bandits\" robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout).Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He destroyed and hunt down McCauley's crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn't let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did, letting go Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi's men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me.Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), as a professional thief was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn't like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break, he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end, he made a mistake when he went after Waingro (Kevin Gage).The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) McCauley (Robert De Niro) firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout's I love it.The movie has great famous cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie.The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life's like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters.Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass.\n",

            "Review 9: An organised crime gang, who carry out multiple thefts and killings attract the attention of The LAPD, who turn up The Heat on the merciless villains.I'm a big fan of those slick and stylish 90s thrillers, throw n Al Pacino it sounds perfect, throw in De Niro and Val Kilmer and you have something that sounds virtually flawless.On paper, they couldn't fail, an incredible cast, a huge budget and a pretty gripping and intriguing storyline, no wonder it's such a highly rated film, it's terrific. It is a long film, at just under three hours long, but it's one of those films where you just aren't aware of time, it definitely absorbs you and allows you to switch off.I can't really come up with a single flaw, I'm struggling to think that this was made all the way back in 1995, time really does fly, the one thing that gives it away, the lack of mobile phones on screen, oh for those days again!It wasn't afraid to be graphic, the scenes of violence look authentic and pretty realistic. It is one immaculately presented film, it looks terrific, plenty of action sequences to keep you entertained.The scenes between De Niro and Pacino, all I can say is this is what The Cinema was made for, to give us such incredible moments on the big screen, several moments of what can only be described a greatness.10/10.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 10: One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He's been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro's gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.This action film also does not stint on woman's roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino's estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro's woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer's loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It's like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.But like in Heat, it should have happened.\n",

            "Review 11: Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.\n",

            "Review 12: What can you say about this movie, that hasn't been said before? Not much, but I state my opinion nonetheless :o).It is undeniably an action classic, although some people will find it (too) slow moving. So if you're more the fast paced action movie viewer, there's a chance that you won't quite enjoy this movie that much.Apart from the well staged action scenes (and the much talked about on-screen meeting of Pacino and De Niro), the supporting cast has to be mentioned. Not only Val Kilmer (who hadn't been that good in a movie since Doc H. in \"Tombstone\" and since then might only have achieved a likewise performance in \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", though comedic and overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr), but every single one. Be it Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight to name a few ...The great film about the movie then (for me) is not the action parts (can't say I don't enjoy them! ;o) ), but the acting in the movie. Nobody is overplaying his/her part.So great acting+good story+well \"executed\"(directed)=Classic (imo)\n",

That's what I feel at the moment.I rate it as Mann's best. It's his most kinetic,vibrant(for a film mostly shot in steely blue),agonising,stirring,brash,violent and brilliance in such a simple story. What games did you play as a young kid? Cops and robbers.Good guy.Bad guy.We all know De Niro and Pacino could have been either main part,but can you imagine it any other way round. Pacino doing ice cool calm? De Niro the manic outbursts,arms flailing? It wouldn't work. We know these men now.We know neither will stop at what they do.And yet there is no way either would stop the other.Unless they had too. Which leads us too the characters. All of them.This is an extended family where you feel you know all of them without knowing anything at all. The cops are similar to the robbers and vice-versa. Perhaps Mann is telling us were all the same.Except in what we do.Every speaking part holds substance in this movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan. And Natalie Portman, for chrissake! Try getting that cast again.A real 10/10 film. And that Moby song at the end(God moving over the face of waters) gets me every time.\n",

I don`t know if I`ve been watching too much MTV but a major problem I`ve had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they`re too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we`d have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson  by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they`re shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It`s a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There`s another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital/romantic life of every major character , cop and robber . I know Michael Mann`s later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but that`s necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is not HEAT isn`t by any means a bad film , on the contaray it`s a good one . DeNiro and Pacino in the same movie , boy what a casting coup . Not only that we get to see Val Kilmer when he was famous plus up and coming names like Portman , Sizemore and Fichtner , and once the story gets going it is very compelling with a breath taking shootout . Unfortunately because someone ( I`m guessing Michael Mann deserves all the blame for this ) thought they`d stretch out a two hour movie into a three hour one HEAT remains good instead of great\n",

            "Review 17: The flaw of all gangster movies, at least those acknowledged as \"classics\" (Godfather trilogy, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, White Heat, Once Upon A Time In America etc), is how obvious and predictable their narrative progressions are. We get the rise, the joyous ecstasy of crime and the obvious monetary rewards, and the fall, that period where the world violently collapses around the criminal. With the scripts all so loosely similar, it just becomes a game of dress up. Of who has the best period details, acting and set design.Released the same year as Scorsese's \"Casino\", Michael Mann's \"Heat\" positions itself as one of the first \"neo liberal\" gangster movies, all the others still caught in the old framework of mafia patriarchy, family values, loyalty, honour, total adherence to a distinctive creed, blood lines and tribalism. \"Heat\", in comparison, completely breaks away from these old-fashioned ways. In Mann's film, everyone is an individual in the most extreme sense. The gang is no longer a gang, but a crew of \"independent professionals\" who just come together for a specific job and then split. In this world, families and friends are non-existent or total charades.While Don Corleone hid like a king behind his armed guards and giant fences, Mann's gangsters are trapped in a state of perpetual mobility. Like a group of shareholders, they are held together only by the prospect of future revenue. Their arrangement is temporary, pragmatic and lateral. They know that they are interchangeable parts in a larger machine, that there are no guarantees and that nothing lasts. Compared to this, the gangsters of \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Godfather\" seem like stagnated sentimentalists, nostalgically trapped in dying communities. While The Corleone's fight over territory and family honour, Mann's guys are only interested in Capital. As DeNiro yells during a bank heist, \"We're here for the bank's money, not your money!\"Tellingly, the DeNiro character's creed is one of \"zero loyalty\". He has a 30-second rule of walking away from anyone, however close he may be emotionally or romantically. The message of the film is thus double edged. It isn't just that the film's final resolution is that \"justice prevails\" and the bad guys are put away; rather, it is that those who fall, who get caught, are those who failed to live up to the modern creed, which is actually repeated twice in the film: \"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.\" In other words, late capitalism and attachment do not mix.So in this sense, a film like \"Heat\", though otherwise entirely predictable, essentially a bunch of little boys engaging in idiot machismo one-upmanship posturing (Pacino's obsessive-compulsive manic cop vs DeNiro's cool sociopathic dedication, etc), nevertheless was one of the first films to manifest a fundamental social change. A series like \"The Wire\" then takes all of this much further, with its attempt to consciously map out the vast and unrepresentable complexity of contemporary neo-liberal capitalism. (In fact, a series like \"The Wire\", with its sheer scope, complexity and writing credentials, renders ALL gangster and crime movies irrelevant to any serious viewer.)And so today's gangsters are all \"entrepreneurs\", all so called \"self-made individuals\", the \"self-employed Petite bourgeoisie\", radically without any social links, even down to the kid selling crack to his buddies. This is all a million light years from the long obsolete world of \"The Godfather\", \"Casino\" or \"Goodfellas\". While those elegiac films are about moments that had long passed, Mann's is distinctively modern. This is a film about the 90s. This is a Los Angeles of polished chrome, designer kitchens, featureless freeways, fluorescent bulbs and late night diners. All the colours, sounds, aromas and cultural quirks of Coppola and Scorsese have been torn out, painted over, re-fitted and re-modelled. Mann's LA is a world without landmarks. A vast urban sprawl, all traces of Old Europe replaced by business franchises, multiplexes and multinational coffee shops. While Coppola's film centred around a family called the \"Corleone's\", their name itself a reference to the village in which they originated, Mann's criminals have bland names like \"Neil\". They are without history, culture or family ties. In a brilliant touch, Mann even has De Niro reading a book on metals when he first meets his love interest. The guy is a piece of cold, polished steel in a world that is likewise.Rather than a \"rise/fall\" structure we also get something a bit different. These criminals get no joy from their profession. Trapped in a world of paranoia, Mann's aesthetic is one of flat glass panes and expansive windows, his criminals always fearing exposure. For Mann, crime becomes a means of escape from the world in its entirety. Crime is total disconnection from both family, society and man, his criminals all looking to amass enough wealth to escape to some idyllic island on the horizon.But it's Mann's style itself that seduces us. This style, which I call \"Armani decorum\", owes much to Mann's fondness for such painters and architects as David Hockney, Alex Colville, Edward Hopper and Ed Ruscha (Alex Colville's \"Pacific\" is visually quoted in one shot). Mann's thus trades the \"old noir\" look for 1950's modernism, block colours, expansive glass panes, geometric divisions and contemporary, linear houses. His frame is divided into flat surfaces, characters are dressed in pastels, scenes are assigned panels of light and buildings are relentlessly modernist, with fluorescent bulbs and geometrical, flat surfaces. Couple this with his unique choice in music (minimalist, industrial and techno) and you have a very sexy aesthetic.8.9/10 – Dismissed upon release, \"Heat\" achieved \"classic\" status a few years later due to young film buffs. As the star status of De Niro and Pacino fades, and films like \"Dark Knight\" rip off its style, the film seems to be on another downward spiral.Worth several viewings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 18: One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 19: 'Heat,' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann's sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, 'Heat' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.Perhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the \"remnants of dead people.\"  A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small).  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.In addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best, at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And, despite his life of crime, McCauley's human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley.  Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions).  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine's daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.And Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.\n",

            "Review 20: I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you. Its a crime thriller. Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best \"shoot-out\" in any film - ever. What more do you want???It's a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines - for example, the recently paroled ex-cell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a \"grill\" working for a nasty, exploitative boss and then ends-up as a stand-in getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the good-guys and the bad-guys that you wouldn't get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed. Just makes it a more satisfying and involving film.Mann who started his career on Miami Vice almost seems to be taking a trip back to the eighties with the soundtrack and styling of the film - almost but not quite. If you still don't want to see the film after this then what the hell's wrong with you?! Sit back and enjoy. Also - no. 247 in the top 250?? Whats up with that???\n",

            "Review 21: Al Pacino is definitely attached to the greatest crime gangster movies in film history: THE GODFATHER trilogy, SCARFACE, CARLITO'S WAY. And so Bob De Niro too: THE GODFATHER 2, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, THE GOOD FELLAS, CASINO. To summarize, because of the presence of these two giants, this movie which I talk now is also to be put on the list, and maybe on the top of it. For me it is the best cop gangster - armed robbers - scheme ever made, and a model, a reference for ant real gangster in the US and Europe. This movie is simply perfect, flawless, tense, taut, gripping, outstanding; unless to hate this kind of movie - and you have the right to - it's impossible to ignore it, this would be an heresy. Acting, directing, editing, everything is purely chiseled like a jewel, a diamond. We could see this as a kind of US remake of Jean Pierre Melville's LE DEUXIEME SOUFFLE where De Niro would have Lino Ventura's role, and Pacino Paul Meurisse's one.\n",

            "Review 22: Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a lonely and sophisticated thief and leader of a gang composed by Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and Trejo (Danny Trejo). They and their families are also close friends. Is the heist of an armored car, the outsider bandit Waingro (Kevin Gage) participates and he unnecessarily executes the guards. Neil decides to eliminate the killer, who escapes due to an incident. Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is a dedicated detective from LAPD, having personal problems with his wife and her teenager daughter. Vincent chases Neil, trying to arrest him. This Michael Mann's movie is one of the best of the 1990's. There are many very well developed and important characters, many action, drama, betrayal, shooting and a great duel between two titans: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. The story is long, but the viewer does not get tired. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Fogo Contra Fogo\" (\"Fire Against Fire\")\n",

            "Review 23: I remember seeing this in my childhood and being extremely impressed with it. Some scenes have stayed with me all this time. However, revisiting \"Heat\" 17 years later was a disappointment. The story looks far fetched and riddled with clichés and improbabilities.The main problem is with the selling point, which is of course the \"Al Pacino- De Niro relationship\". Here's the problem: no cop who does this job out of conviction could possibly respect/admire a criminal, especially one who has killed other police officers. So the ending is absurd and downright ludicrous. The famous coffee-shop scene that Pacino and De Niro share is ridiculous and pointless, entirely made for us, the viewers. At the public request, we present you Pacino and De Niro, face to face! The clash of the titans! Not only there is no way in hell that a committed policeman would casually sit and chat with a criminal over coffee, but what they have to say is so silly – sharing thoughts about their messed-up private lives? Pacino trying to talk De Niro out of the bank robbery business? Seriously? Such a lame excuse to deliver the much anticipated De Niro- Pacino \"moment\"... The writing is terrible in this scene, as De Niro is also restating something he'd said earlier, therefore diminishing the impact of that line. Another example of bad writing and poor characterization is a scene where Jon Voight warns De Niro about Pacino's tenacity.The constant shift to everybody's private lives was annoying and turned the whole thing into a crime-opera cheesefest. How many times have we seen the \"frustrated cop's wife\" act? And who cares about the bank robber's problems with his beloved wife, whom he occasionally cheats on? Oh, yeah, bank robbers are capable of love too. Touching! Talking about unlikelihood, De Niro's \"romance\" was laughable, and so was the transformation of an innocent librarian into an accessory to murder. The way Amy Brenneman switches from horror at what De Niro did to the \"Oh, well, he's cute anyway\" is hysterical. Moral relativism is an interesting topic for sure, but not here. There are moments that we're supposed to find moving, like the miscast Ashley Judd shedding a tear on the balcony or the cop hero Pacino holding hands with a criminal... What a joke.The movie does contain some entertaining moments (although highly improbable), like the robbery scene. There's no way the Police would get into a shootout like that with so many civilians around. The suicide attempt scene is unnecessary and forced, and there are other flaws and extremely far-fetched/illogical scenes throughout, like DeNiro & the gang gracefully passing through police check-points without even wearing a disguise, just hours after the bloody robbery.\"Heat\" is fairly entertaining only if you can ignore its inconsistencies and plot holes. The more I watch, the more I find it insulting to one's intelligence. I know it's \"just a movie\", but come on... it's a 3-hour movie, and such an amount of implausible developments make suspension of disbelief pretty hard. I swear, if Pacino had shed a tear in the end, I would have rated \"Heat\" with 10 stars and put it on my all time favorite \"so bad they're good\" list.\n",

            "Review 24: Al Pacino plays a cop and an avid hunter who, once he gets a scent of his prey, feels some sort of self-motivation that perpetuates him He is a jackal addicted to this process This is an elevated state of being an intensely eager predator pursuing his prey until he gets him down As strange as it is, as scary as that world is, Lt. Hanna has a social conscience He has a normal spectrum of human feelings He's very authentic in how he loves his life The fusion of Robert De Niro and Neil McCauley is so total He's committed to the rigidity of that perspective and it's a heartbreaking role It's a tragic character In his world, what he's doing, he feels justified in doing it McCauley has a quiet look at a thief who has a certain kind of lonely disregard for who he kills but yet somehow you're in touch with his humanity We can identify him when all that robbery turns out badly and when his lover Eady (Amy Brenneman) tries to escape from him Brenneman's part was the hope that De Niro's character could have of escape, and love, and forgiveness There's something so sad about these people and so poignant They are so lost, and they want to be found so badlyIt's like a huge opera On one level, the film deals with a crime saga, on the other, with the interpersonal relationships that are woven all these charactersIn the Pacino character and in the De Niro character you're basically seeing two sides of the same tough man\n",

            "Review 25: In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today.  \"Heat\" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering \"who could be so lucky to work with them?\". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) \"Heat\" grabs you and pulls you in.  This is a true film masterpiece.\n",

            "Review 2: GoldenEye (1995) is my number 1 personal favorite movie of all time! James Bond 007 action film the best one that was ever made. In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get's bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction from Martin Campbell. The stunts are completely insane in scale in this movie and really dangerous.Music score is by Éric Serra, the title song is GoldenEye performed by Tina Turner. GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond: Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.Style and sophistication are in abundance - - \"The name's Bond. James Bond.\" Goldeneye's female characters are honestly beautiful with particular techniques. The bad one is Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an ex-Soviet fighter pilot who tranquilly smokes big cigars and knocks off her victims with her 'killer thighs.' In one scene, she challenges Bond's legendary Aston Martin DB5 to a wild road race outside Monte Carlo with her red Ferrari: in another she was so smart that she snatches a top-secret helicopter from under the noses of the French navy. Izabella Scorupco is a great and the finest Bond girl, the irresistible Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) who 'tastes like strawberries.' Natalya possesses all the technical ability to neutralize Janus' scheme or to destroy all computer records with the GoldenEye As one who survived a mass murder, this lovely beauty is suddenly a marked woman.James Bond investigates the theft of the control disk for the GoldenEye satellite. His investigation leads to an organization of arms dealers Janus and the reappearance of someone from Bond's past. James Bond must deal with betrayal of his old friend Alec Trevelyan (006) gone rogue, from using a satellite GoldenEye against London to cause a global financial meltdownWhy I also love this movie to death beside the action is because of the great villains who created evil characters. Such as: Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006), Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp: A Georgian lust murderer, Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko: A computer programmer.It was filmed in beautiful locations in Puerto Rico, Russia, England, UK and in the France.The movie has a lot of insane hard-core action (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), The stunts are completely insane in scale (bungee jumping in - Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility a stunt man performed that stunt in the opening scene.) Bond with a motorcycle jumps on a plane and catches it. Bond drives a tank in Russia for the first time and he demolishes even police cars that was excellent scene. Bond a stuntman jumps out of the window in Russia. Alec Trevelyan's train depot - exploding train. The epic climatic fight on the end of the movie between Bond and Trevelyan in his secret Goldeneye satellite control dish in Cuba in which Bond drops Trevelyan out of dish beautiful and really crazy stunt performance.I love the soundtracks in this movie: Goldeneye by Tina Turner and The Experience of Love by Éric Serra. I just love everything about this movie from the actions, to the heroes, to the villains from acting everything abut this movie I just love so much.GoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it.\n",

MI6 -Judi Dench as M- assigns to James Bond the mission to retrieve it . Of course , there's the usual breathtaking opening scene developed in a chemist arms factory located in Siberia . There Bond and agent 006 Alec Trevelyan -Sean Bean- will have to confront against Russian military , but Alec is imprisoned by General Ourumov -Gottfried John- and at the end takes place a deadly confrontation . The film has sensational and spectacularly difficult action set pieces , as the tank pursuit in the city of Saint Petesburg or the taking on the armored train . Action is well shot , , including a groundbreaking and impressive final confrontation developed in Janus headquarter , located in Island Cuba jungle . As always , it appears Q as gadget man who teaches Bond various tools as a bomb pencil that will have special importance posteriorly , besides a speed car -BMW- equipped with rockets launchers . As Bond girls are Famke Janssen as Xena in a sensationalistic and crazed interpretation as the orgasmic to whom all risk is a emotion . Thus , she steals a super-helicopter ¨Tiger¨ and facing off opponents .Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simanova , a computer specialist , she is marvelous and enticing with a similar countenance to Ingrid Bergman .

            "Review 4: GoldenEye is entertainment, not as classy as some of those before, but among the very best in the series.Perhaps the greatest portrayal of the lead character, with Brosnan and certainly the best opening sequence. There's no way he could make it, heh. The first half much better than the second, they all seem to go on and on though. The Bond girl Scorupco, one of the weakest. However Janssen makes up for it, taking the whole Grace Jones villainess role to another level. Bean an excellent counterpart as well. The secondary characters all decent, could do without Dench though. The song by Tina Turner, outstanding.Alec: For England, James? Bond: No. For me!\n",

            "Review 5: One of my favourite quotes from this film you know. As for GoldenEye, I consider it the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films. Pierce Brosnan makes for a great and likable title character, and Judi Dench is rock-solid as always as M. Izabella Scorupco is a splendid Natalya and I loved feisty Xenia, marvellously played by Famke Janssen, who kills her victims by crushing them between her thighs, while Janus is wonderfully mysterious as a villain. Technically, GoldenEye can't be faulted either. The cinematography is beautiful, while the locations are superb and the stunts perfectly done especially the car chase through the streets of St Petersburg. The music and theme song are very memorable too, the pacing is brisk and the script and plot are well intact. GoldenEye mayn't be the best Bond film ever, but it is for me one of the more enjoyable ones. 9/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 6: This movie fully deserves it's status as a classic in the action/thriller/spy/drama category. It's so much fun, well written, solid dialogue and yet it finds that sweet spot with just the right amount of classic Bond ridiculousness. Famke Jensenn playing Onatopp, a soviet assassin who kills men by riding them to death in bed? Yup, sounds like a Bond movie. Judi Dench absolutely kills it as M, I love the gravitas and complexity she brings to the role. Even back in 1995 calling out Bond, what some would consider to be the fictional epitome of toxic masculinity and chauvinism, and saying he's a dinosaur and that she has no problem sending him off to die if she has to. Love her so much in this. As for Bond himself, this may be because I grew up in this period but I have always loved Brosnan in the role. Yes, the later films get exponentially more absurd and the quality absolutely goes down but he is so perfectly cast as the suave, charming and devilish-at-times international man of mystery. That man wears the hell out of those suits, drinks a martini with the best of them and looks just right in that Aston Martin.Definite recommend for people interested in a solid action flick. The plot is a little crazy, but that was perfectly in line with when it was made and the style of film it's going for. Easily worth a rent.\n",

            "Review 7: This film is the best of the classic James Bond films, i.e. those before the Daniel Craig reboot. It hits the right tone where it is not too serious but also not too silly either. The pacing is exciting and Pierce Brosnan is classy as always.\n",

            "Review 8: GOLDENEYE, the long-delayed debut of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, was a film mired in MGM's convoluted legal problems for six years, problems which had nothing to do with the 007 franchise, but which happened to fall at the worst possible time; after Timothy Dalton's 'Serious Bond' experiment, LICENCE TO KILL, failed to break even in U.S. markets. Despite international grosses that made the film a profitable venture, many American critics, long grumbling that the Bond series had outlasted it's welcome, heaped abuse on the newer, leaner direction for 'Bond', and it's taciturn, less light-hearted star...and, with MGM's decision to put the expensive series 'on hold' until their own legal and financial issues could be resolved, LICENCE TO KILL became the unfair 'scapegoat' for the delay.Much happened during the six-year hiatus; with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist undercurrent of many Bond films (and the subject of most of Ian Fleming's novels) was lost; Richard Maibaum, the series' most prolific screenwriter, passed away, and ill health forced legendary producer Albert ('Cubby') Broccoli to turn over his duties to his daughter Barbara, and stepson, Michael G. Wilson (thus ending the other 'prime' 007 screenwriter's script contributions); many other key production figures would retire, die, or move on; and finally, as the delay continued, Timothy Dalton, nearing 50, announced that he was no longer interested in playing James Bond (sparking rumors that Eon Productions, no longer honor-bound by the senior Broccoli's choices, had given him 'the boot').While all this opened the door for Pierce Brosnan's long-awaited debut as 007 (after his aborted first attempt, in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS), with a new 'look' and style for the franchise, whether audiences would even accept a new 'James Bond' adventure was in doubt. Fortunately, everything 'worked'. Brosnan, now 42, was more ruggedly believable as 007 than he would have been, at 34, and Dame Judi Dench, as the first woman 'M' (referring to Bond as a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\"), proved a perfect successor to the late Bernard Lee. While the plot of the film, involving the master plan of a renegade Russian General (Gottfried John) and an assumed dead 006 (Sean Bean) to use an electronic warfare system (GoldenEye) against England was nothing new, Brosnan's daring-do and one-liners (with humor restored to the franchise), as he proved his value in the new world 'order', found an audience 'primed' for James Bond's return...and the welcome cameo of the series' last original 'regular', \"Q\" (Desmond Llewelyn, 81, and as cranky as ever), cemented 007's links to both the past and the future.James Bond's greatest crisis, whether he still had 'Box Office', had been overcome, and with audience favorite Pierce Brosnan in place, his emergence into the 21st century was assured.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 9: This was Pierce Brosnan's first outing as Bond and is a real success. It managed to keep the quintessential Bond attributes yet brings the franchise bang up to date in the absence of the Cold War. Brosnan puts in a stellar performance as Bond and the supporting cast including the gritty Sean Bean as the double crossing villain and just the right amount comedy in Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade and Robbie Coltrane as Valentine Zukovsky. Nice nods to the past in the use of the Aston DB5 and mentions of M's predecessors. Even the soundtrack suits the film nicely. There is enough grit and spy content to please the Dalton fans and enough quips and craziness to please the Moore fans. Misses are few and far between - the product placement of the flaccid BMW 1.9 Z3 is poor - it so obviously Un-Bondlike that even the production crew realise and the below par motor barely features in the film at all. This aside, it's great Bond movie, one of the best infact and well worth a watch.\n",

            "Review 10: The James Bond franchise, in cinematic terms, began in 1962 with Dr No. There followed a Bond movie every couple of years or so (the longest gap between two 007 films was the three-year-hiatus separating The Man With The Golden Gun - 1974 - and The Spy Who Loved Me - 1977). Then, in 1989, with the release of Licence To Kill the series seemed to die. The box office returns of that film were disappointing; the then-Bond actor Timothy Dalton was axed; the film itself was presented in a grittier, more adult style than fans were accustomed to; and various legal wranglings put the Bond character into limbo. Six long years went by without a Bond movie and many insiders predicted an end for the British super-spy and his outrageous screen adventures. Too much time had gone by, they said, no-one was interested any longer in the character or the stories. But then Goldeneye came along, with Pierce Brosnan as Bond - it went on to become a commercial hit, propelling its star into the A-list and reinvigorating the entire series.James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) and his secret agent colleague Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) infiltrate a Russian military installation on a sabotage mission. During the mission, Alec is apparently killed by the enemy forces but Bond manages a miraculous escape. Several years later, a state-of-the-art helicopter is stolen from the West by some Russian spies and used to destroy a Siberian satellite station. When Bond investigates, he discovers to his surprise that the plot involves his old colleague Alec - who is very much alive, having faked his death in the earlier exchange. Trevelyan's plan is to get control of a powerful satellite called the Goldeneye and to use it to destroy a designated target on Earth - in this case, London. It emerges that his parents were Liensk Cossacks, brutally killed by the British when he was a boy, and he has long plotted a way to have his revenge. Bond teams up with a Russian computer programmer, Natalya Semyonova (Isabella Scorupco) and pursues Trevelyan around the globe in an effort to stop his sinister scheme. The trail leads to Cuba, where Trevelyan has a secret lair from which he is on the very brink of unleashing chaos upon the world.... unless 007 can find a way to thwart him.Goldeneye begins with a truly outrageous stunt involving Bond freefalling in pursuit of an unpiloted, plummeting airplane. This dumb but enjoyable scene sets the tone for the rest of the film - very much a tongue-in-cheek, improbable, action-orientated romp. Brosnan is OK as Bond, though I still feel Sean Connery and Roger Moore were slightly better suited to the role. Tina Turner's powerful theme song is very good, but the incidental scoring by Eric Serra has a tinny, tacky feel to it that makes one long for John Barry! As the bad guy, Sean Bean is effective enough even if he never quite matches the memorableness of the all-time great Bond villains (eg Dr No, Oddjob, Blofeld, Francisco Scaramanga). The Bond girls are very good in this one - Scorupco plays a pleasingly resourceful character, while Famke Janssen has great fun as a female baddie who crushes victims between her thighs. Goldeneye is by no means the best of the Bond series, but one has to be thankful to it for getting the dormant series up and running once more. And, in its pacy, breakneck way, it is undeniably a lot of fun.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 11: Pierce Brosnan's first outing as the iconic spy was a good one. Goldeneye hit the mark with a great story, a progressive M, Bond girl and soundtrack. Pierce makes the role his own and nicely takes on the mantle of 007. Viewers can embrace a new and modern Bond for the 90s. Goldeneye is a special film for me as it was the first 007 film I watched with my parents and it hit the bullseye for me. I was captivated by this great story from start to finish. Decent film and Pierce's best Bond film.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 12: After a long hiatus the Bond franchise returned with a new actor. Timothy Dalton didn't want to star in many Bond films from Goldeneye as Cubby wanted him to star in more than three, so the role eventually went to Pierce Brosnan, who had, like Roger Moore, been on the verge of donning the famed tux but a TV contract came in the way. And does he fit the role like a glove; from his first appearance upside down above a bog you just buy him in the role, and he plays with a stiff, yet boyishly charming style. Elegant, yet no-nonsense when needed, and is really great with the one-liners ( \"What, no small-talk? No chit-chat? That's the trouble with the world today. No one takes the time to do a really sinister interrogation anymore. It's a lost art.\")\n",
            "The film itself is an extravaganza, plenty of action, well-choreographed ( tank scene) and the plot just flows with no boring bits. But there's some depth, especially when centred around the tragic tone regarding the duplicity of Sean Bean's character. Famke Jansen almost steals the scene as a villain who likes a tight squeeze. That pen twirling bloke who chimes on being invincible is really suitably annoying ( as he is meant to be) and the Bond lead actress was great. Everything is working in this 007 classic.\n",

            "Review 13: Bond 17 welcomes Pierce Brosnan as the tuxedo wearing MI6 secret agent. Besides Brosnan, a lot has changed since the last outing for Bond in the film franchise, and this film sees an almost re-birth of the franchise for the 1990'sReleased in 1995 this film was directed by Martin Campbell, who would later go on to direct Daniel Craig in \"Casino Royal\" too. Campbell replaced John Glen who worked on 5 Bond films and reinvigorated the franchise during the 80's. Michael France steps in as writer replacing Richard Maibaum (who worked on 14 Bond films) and Michael G. Wilson (who stepped into a Production role), with Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein writing the screenplay. Ian Fleming of course is the mastermind behind the main characters in this, although the story is not based on any of his books - which is the first time that a completely original version of Bond has hit the screen. Eric Serra steps up into music department which John Barry previously monopolised. While some of Barry's original scoring is present still, Serra brings an updated score to a fresh new generation of Bond. The theme song to accompany the open credits was \"Goldeneye\" which was sung by Tina Turner. Previously the production team for the film would work with the musical artists so that themes of the film were incorporated into the song, but not this time. This time the song was written by Bono and The Edge from the band U2. Also, noteworthy, Albert R. Broccoli took a step away due to ill health and was mainly a consultant, his daughter Barbara took up his production role with his stepson Michael G. Wilson. Unfortunately, Albert would die 7 months after the release of this film. Running at 130 minutes this film had a budget of $60 million and grossed a whopping $352 million - which makes Bond's relaunch a massive success.The most obvious refresh is in the title character, Pierce Brosnan replaces Timothy Dalton. Dalton was due to come back, but due to legal wrangling this production of this film did not start for 4-5 years, by which time Dalton's contract had expired. He initially agreed he would come back for a single film, but Broccoli wanted him to sign on for 4-6 films which Dalton did not want to do. So rather than renewing Dalton at all, Broccoli turned to Irishman Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan had been considered for the role prior to Dalton, but he was committed to an NBC contract to play \"Remmington Steele\". The writers did adapt the version of Bond for Brosnan as best as they could, but the fact of the matter remains, the film was written with Dalton in mind for the title role, which is why there is still a darkness to the character. It's amusing to look back at other people considered for the role, the studio considered Mel Gibson (they considered him before choosing Dalton in the 80's too), Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and even Paul McGann were considered. In his role, Brosnan is brilliant, he manages to combine the approach other Bond actors gave; he manages to be as dark as Dalton, as witty and charming as Moore, and as direct and professional as Connery (sorry Lazenby, you didn't get a mention because in one film you didn't manage to stamp your mark on the franchise). Not only does he manage to combine other Bond performances, but he also manages to put his own classy stamp on the film, he is cool, stylish, and savvy. His Bond is every part an action hero but dressed down in comfortable clothes.As well as Bond being recast, some of the regular reoccurring characters were recast too. Judi Dench replaces Robert Brown as Bond's MI6 boss \"M\". This was a bold move but was not the first time a female boss was considered. When Lois Maxwell was about to step away from playing Miss Moneypenny she suggested a female \"M\" which was actually considered, but the eventual decision was that the world wasn't ready yet. In the 1990's the world was a little more ready for a female boss, but regardless of is it was ready or not, Judi Dench absolutely commanded the role and stole the attention when she was in frame. Miss Moneypenny was recast with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond. She does not appear for a long time, but she is witty and charming for her time on screen. The only actor from the reoccurring characters to survive the refresh was Desmond Llewelyn as Q. There are some new reoccurring characters that are introduced here, which I can mention with the benefit of hindsight. Joe Don Baker is CIA operative Jack Wade, replacing the Felix Leiter character that came before him. The character is portrayed as a bumbling loud, chubby American which is in complete contrast to the mannerisms of Bond. Choosing this stereotype of a character seems like it's very tongue in cheek, but because Wade doesn't get a lot of screen time it works well. Robbie Coltrane's Valentin Zukovsky is also a character that you will see again in the next Bond film. Coltrane's portray is decent but not absolutely necessary. It feels like he is shoehorned in for a little bit of comedic relief - which is further backed up by his on-screen girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver) and her terrible singing.There are three main villains in this film, General Ourumov (Gottfried John), Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) and Alec Treveluyan (Sean Bean). All three of which give varying but great performances that are different from other villains that Bond has faced before. Ourumov is the maniacal Russian general with a hidden agenda, he is menacing and dangerous. Onatopp is a very over the top henchwoman but she is unmistakably a powerful female in a Bond film who poses as much as threat as 007. Famke Janssen does well in the role and brings to life a performance which I feel could have been a lot cheesier. Sean Bean sits at the top of the bad guy pyramid and he is great. The character is supposed to the decedent of Lienz Cossacks, who worked with MI6 for a long time to cover up his plot for revenge. He does great to play a charming character that is extremely dangerous. I am not too keen on Bean's quintessential English accent in this film, I prefer it when he's true to his Yorkshire roots, but ignoring his accent his performance is very strong. Sean Bean's role could have been played by Alan Rickman or Anthony Hopkins but they turned it down. Hopkins would again be approached for a role in \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" only to turn it down again then. The use of a former MI6 agent as the lead protagonist in the film was a change from using archetypal bad guys such as Nazi's, drug lords, or mad scientists. This was partly down to the changing times of the era. Worldwide politics had changed dramatically since \"License to Kill\", this was actually the first Bond film after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and after the end of the Cold War; the Berlin wall in Germany had also come down too. The new bad guys were the ones sat at the end of a computer who had the power to bring down nations with the press of a keyboard button. It was important that Bond changed with the times and it did that by having Alan Cumming's Boris character as the computer whizz, controlled by the former intelligence agent that Sean Bean portrayed.Izabella Scorupco as Natalya is the typical Bond girl of the film, but with her computer knowledge she is more than just eye-candy. At different times she allows the plot to continue advancing with the information and solutions she puts in front of Bond. It is fair to say without this character the film would not advance the way it does. Scorupco does a lovely job in the role demonstrates a wide range of emotions that she puts on plate for the audience to empathise with her. Alan Cumming is her technical counterpart then nemesis in the role. I found this character to be slightly annoying at times but again he is integral to the plot. The fact that I considered the character to be annoying is testament to Cumming's performance, if he invokes emotion then he has done well.So, there were a lot of firsts in the film, more firsts came in the studio used. This was the inaugural film to be shot at Leavesden Studios. It was also the first Bond film to use CGI too. Add to that the casting changes and the production team changes, and you have a Bond film that on the surface may look familiar, but the parts are all new. Like a classic car that has had a new engine added, an approach that seemed to work as audiences loved this Bond film and it won plenty of plaudits and awards. The name Goldeneye comes from a manoeuvre that Ian Fleming took part in while with the Naval Intelligence Division, it is also the name of his estate in Jamaica.All in all, I really enjoyed the film. I consider it to be a fantastic rebirth of the franchise and all the players from cast and the production team do a great job. Its family friendly enough that kids or grandparents can watch it without being upset or offended, but it is equally able to be a grown-up film with lots of action and intelligence in it too. The film is everything that you would expect or want from a Bond film and with Brosnan able to combine all the other Bond performances in his portrayal in this film, it should make fans new and old happy. I am happy to recommend this film and I am certain you'll have fun watching it too.In terms of Bond films this is a 9 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 8 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 14: After a 6 year hiatus due to protracted legal wranglings as to WHO owned the BOND film rights, GOLDENEYE was finally made! It was worth the wait! With the almost impossible assignment of both retaining the quintessential METHOD of the Connery period and the need to drag Bond screaming into the new millennium and its new technology, Martin Campbell actually pulled it off.Brosnan, though not my personal favorite I have to say, did a damn near remarkable job, by not only bringing elements of Connery, Dalton and Moore to the role, but by stamping it with his own identity (he WAS actually first choice ahead of Dalton but was contractually tied to REMINGTON STEELE and could not gain a release!)Wishing to link back with the earlier mega successful Bonds, the very title of GOLDENEYE was inspirational, immediately bringing to mind the latent image of GOLDFINGER. Not one half bad title song either compared to some recent efforts.With Bernard Lee's sad demise, Judy Dench made a brilliant replacement as M, all balls and bravado. Similarly, Moneypenny is now a strictly new-age secretary admonishing 007 for his sexual harassment of her good self! Dearest of all, Desmond Llewelyn still shines as \"Q\" berating 007 for his behaviour and telling him to \"grow up.\"Famke Janssen is a throw-back to the good old days of Bond badgirls as the aptly named Xenia Onatopp. Izabella Scorupco however must be the most beautiful of all the \"good\" Bond girls. Feminine to the core and everything the average man would want to love and protect she is is simply yummy.....no more so than when she chides 007's cold-war repartee with his Russian counterpart as \"Boys with Toys\"  Soo cute!Action was at a premium from the rip-snorting bungee-jump (pre-credits) to the climactic battle atop the communications tower. Everything gelled in this movie to elevate it to amongst the top 5 Bond films...no question! Top dialog, state of the art fx, innuendos on tap and a really first rate villain. Shame none of the later Brosnan outings have come close to this one!8.8 out of 10!\n",

            "Review 15: A lot has happened since 'Licence to Kill'; not only has Timothy Dolton been replaced by Pierce Brosnan but the Soviet Union is no more; but this doesn't mean you can't have villainous Russians any more. The prologue took place six years previously when the Soviet Union still existed; it featured Bond dramatically breaking into a Soviet installation where he is joined by 006, his friend Alex Trevelyan; the mission is a success but before he escapes Bond sees 006 being shot in the head by General Ourumov.Once the action has switched to the present Bond has a run in with Xenia Onnatopp, a member of the criminal Janus group. She steals a prototype advanced helicopter; it is special because unlike other aircraft it is shielded from EM radiation. The next time the helicopter is seen it is at a remote Russian facility; the home of the GoldenEye satellite based EM pulse weapon. When it lands Onnatopp and Ourumov get out and kill the people working there; with two exceptions; Boris Grishenko, the inside man and Natalya Simonova a programmer who just got lucky and survived. Before departing with the weapon's control unit they use one of the satellites to destroy the facility. Bond heads to St. Petersburg to meet the leader of the Janus group and when he finds him he has quite a surprise! Meanwhile Natalya has made her way to St. Petersburg and met her 'friend' Boris... this leads to Bond and Natalya meeting each other... just before they going to be killed! Needless to say they escape and after a series of spectacular incidents they confront Janus again; this time in Cuba.After the light-hearted Roger Moore era things got more serious for Timothy Dalton's two films; clearly they have gone someway back again although this still more serious than the Moore era films. There is a lot of impressive action including dramatic shootouts, explosions and a chase through St. Petersburg where Bond is driving a tank... and it was actually filmed in St. Petersburg... growing up I certainly never thought I'd see a Bond film made in Russia! The story is standard Bond fare but there is nothing wrong with that; it is after all a winning formula. Brosnan makes a good Bond and this is probably his best outing in the role. Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen were good as Natalya and Onnatopp although the latter's character was a bit too over the top; it looked liked she was about to climax as she gunned people down let alone when she killed somebody in bed! There was a nice twist midway through when we learn who Janus was so to avoid spoiling it I won't say who played Janus but will say I thought he did a decent job. There were some silly moments I could have done without but they weren't enough to really detract from this fine romp of a film.\n",

            "Review 16: Goldeneye is an action spy movie directed by Martin Campbell and stars Pierce Brosnan, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Famke Janssen, Judi Dench, Joe Don Baker and Alan Cumming.This movie was seventeenth movie in James Bond series and first to star Pierce Brosnan.The movie came after the gap of 06 years and had to admit that came with a bang. The plot of bond movies are majorly similar and this movie also has little exception regarding the plot. The execution is great and will keep you engaged to the movie.Screenplay of the movie is fast paced and keeps you glued to the screen. Direction of the movie is good. Acting is great and Brosnan looks fantastic in the portray of Bond. Judi Dench was commendably great in her portrayal of 'M' rest of the cast were also impressive.Climax of the movie is good and gives a superb closure to the movie. Cinematography was good but could've been little better. Music is impressive.A great bond movie to watch.\n",

            "Review 17: Much had changed for James Bond since Sean Connery first took the role in 1962. The series had taken a turn for the worse in the seventies, when five films were made but zero good ones were. Still, the public was willing to grant Bond limitless amnesty that decade, even as his escapades grew less and less exciting and more and more campy with each new film. The 70s came and went, ushering in the 80s, which kicked off well with 1981's \"For Your Eyes Only.\" However, it went all downhill from there as the public finally stopped tolerating the bad movies and his popularity tanked in favor of superior competition. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger became mega stars during that time, and the emergence Indiana Jones was making Bond look dull and decrepit by comparison. Tim Burton's summer sweep of the cinemas with \"Batman\" in 1989 exacerbated Bond's woes, and when legal disputes arose between the production company and the studio shortly thereafter, it appeared that Bond had finally died his horrible but well deserved death.When the legal issues were finally put to rest in 1994, it was announced that another Bond film was going to be made, but not with erstwhile incumbent Timothy Dalton. Pierce Brosnan was given the role after being forced to reject it in the late eighties, and production began. The success of the film was crucial. If it lacked spark or came across as campy, it was likely that Bond would be finished forever. With the stakes in mind, the Broccoli family (the Bond producers) hired an all-new creative team and set to work re-establishing 007 in a new era.I knew none of that when I first saw the film in 1999. It was my introduction to the world of James Bond, and was a truly an exceptional first handshake. Knowing what I know now, and seeing the Bond films I have seen now, I still find it as worthwhile as I did then, and I am forever thankful that it was made well enough to not only resuscitate Bond, but propel him into the nineties with the momentum of a blazing fastball.The film opens in the eighties, ironically, with a scene depicting the Bond and Agent 006, real name Alec Trevelyan, being detected inside a Soviet chemical weapons factory. This section also introduces the character of Ourumov (Gottfried John), who murders Alec seemingly on a whim.Nine years later, Bond meets an appealing young lady (Famke Janssen) while driving...make that playfully racing, near Monte Carlo. Suspicious, he follows her to a nearby casino where he finds out that her name is Xenia Onatopp and she carries ties to the Janus crime syndicate in St. Petersburg. He chases Xenia when he suspects an imminent crime, but is not in time to avert her theft of the Tiger--a helicopter that is hardened to all forms of electronic interference.Back at MI-6 headquarters, the Tiger is spotted via satellite at Russian satellite control facility, and it soon becomes obvious that the copter is merely part of a grander scheme to steal a scary satellite weapon called GoldenEye. What it does can be described with words, but not with as much clarity as seeing it in the movie (there are lapses in the visuals here, but the sight is so impressive that they hardly matter). Bond then departs for St. Petersburg to find the Janus head man (Sean Bean) and stop him from using GoldenEye on a more vulnerable target. Much mystery surrounds the identity of Janus, but it is in the trailer and I suspect most people know it by now.There are several reasons that \"GoldenEye\" is the best Bond film made in many, many years. The first is the tone, which has ushered out all of the giddy goofiness of Roger Moore's films and assumed one reminiscent of the earliest Bond films. The sets, the camera work and the dialogue all come across as subtle, subconscious reminders of why Bond became so beloved to begin with.I always felt there were two major problems with the Bonds of the seventies and eighties. The first is the inane tone (exception: \"For Your Eyes Only,\"), a point I am driving into the ground. With the same exception, they also featured uniformly unexciting (read it: bad) action plus horrendous acting. There are light moments in \"GoldenEye,\" as there should be, but the correct tone is never compromised. The only problem is that there is a little too much padding in the middle. The story is well told, although there is a meeting with Bond and Valentin Zukovsky (reprised by Robbie Coltrane in \"The World is Not Enough\") that has no significance to the advancement of the story. It is unnecessary and causes the film to drag some. After Bond meets Janus, though, prepare for the film to take off, as there will be little rest from there on out.Just like in the early Bonds, the acting transcends the genre. Pierce Brosnan is the clear focal point, and is mostly successful. He seems too reserved at times, as if he is a little timid at acting his best for fear it might look bad. He does not lack charm, though, because there is something about Pierce that makes him the ultimate ladies man on screen and off.\n",
            "More successful is Sean Bean as James's opponent. Bean brings cold, subtle intensity to the role that shows off the acting skills that got him cast in \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\" General Ourumov, who is in bed with Janus, provides a second bad guy. Gottfried John portrays him as a demonstrative brute, and his style provides a fine foil to Bean's controlled anger. Alan Cumming plays an evil computer nerd who provides most the light moments I referred to earlier. Fellow X-Man Famke Janssen's character is downright demented, and will not be forgotten easily.My friends, I have just explained why \"GoldenEye\" is a most superior Bond film that brought Agent 007 back from the dead and won over a new generation of fans. The best way I can think of to conclude this review is to comment on the film's conclusion. At one point it involves a brawl between Bond and Janus (who is referred to by his real name by that time) that buries just about every other one in the series. While it does quite not take the gold from the fistfight that opens \"Thunderball,\" is does serve as a final reminder that Bond is indeed back, and that he is once again a force best not ignored.\n",

            "Review 18: It's sentimental favorite time here at Hot Toasty Rag. GoldenEye is the best James Bond movie ever. I excuse my sentimental statement for two reasons: One, because everyone believes the actor who portrayed James Bond when they were kids was the best and will never be equaled. Two, because I really haven't seen another 007 movie that was better than the first I watched. I'll never forget going to the movie theaters on Thanksgiving weekend to see it with my family. Since my previous movie theater outings were Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, going to see a real-people movie was a big deal. I thought Pierce Brosnan was so handsome, he wasn't a real person: he must be a Ken doll brought to life and put up on the big screen.With no knowledge that the 007 movies were a series, the opening credits and classic theme were magical. The first \"Bond, James Bond\", the first martini, the introduction of each spy gadget... Pierce Brosnan was the perfect Bond; even those who grew up with someone else and feel obliged to name him as their favorite readily admit to the '90s Bond as the second-best. Even though I've seen him in a million other movies, he'll always be James Bond. He's just too classy, handsome, charming, and perfect to be anybody else. And, to this day, whenever I see Sean Bean in the opening credits of a movie I say, \"Oo, it's 006!\" I'm sure it's not how these fine actors wish to be remembered, but that's what sentimentality does.From an un-sentimental perspective, GoldenEye is pretty hilarious. And James Bond movies are supposed to be charmingly humorous, aren't they? The Russians are the bad guys, the click of a pen can destroy the world, and the villainess finds beating people up an aphrodisiac. But when you're not chuckling, you can appreciate the awesome action sequences, the introduction of Judi Dench as M, and the adorable Izabella Scorupco as the Bond girl. How adorable is her haircut (and how '90s)? Ever since I saw this movie, I wanted to cut my hair; but I had to wait ten years before my parents let me. If you haven't seen GoldenEye in a while, get out your old VHS copy and pop it in the VCR. Retro night comin' right up!\n",

            "Review 19: I've probably watched GoldenEye more than any other Bond film. I really enjoy this movie. It manages to reboot the franchise in a way that acknowledges past weaknesses while still maintaining the spirit of James Bond. There are plenty of flaws I could point out, but the ride is enjoyable enough that I'm willing to forgive most of them. And Pierce Brosnan works so well as 007. It's just a shame his other entries weren't as good as this one.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 20: Pierce Brosnan was the best looking and least likable of the six actors to play 007 for the Eon production team. No film demonstrates this better than this, his first.It's a new decade for James Bond. Now he works for a woman, has to be evaluated for mental fitness, and with the fall of the Soviet Union must rely on the friendship of old enemies not to mention the enmity of old friends. All this comes into play when he is sent to discover the reason for an explosion at a Russian satellite monitoring station.When \"GoldenEye\" came out, more than six years had passed since the last Bond movie. Many wondered if time had passed James by. The movie plays this up when Bond is called a \"sexist, misogynistic dinosaur\" by his new M (Judi Dench). Bond seems unfazed by this, and everything else.\"Trick is to quit while you're still ahead,\" says his most charming adversary in this adventure, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen).\"That's one trick I've never learned,\" Bond replies.Brosnan looks fantastic in the action sequences, better than any Bond before him, and his James Coburn-like grin rivals Connery's smirk and Moore's raised eyebrow for a facial signature. Too bad his overall smugness gets in the way. Here's one Bond you actually root against, especially when pitted against Onatopp. Employing missionary zeal if not position in her quest for the perfect kill, Onatopp is one of Bond's most memorable adversaries, and a riot as played by the brave Janssen.Also helping matters a lot is the film's other Bond girl, Izabella Scorupco, and a nifty title song from Tina Turner written by Bono and The Edge that captures the spirit if not the sound of 1960s Bond movies. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) gets off some good lines.What loses me about this movie most is the second half, where a once-taut and plausible story (well, except for Bond jumping off a cliff and into an airplane) gives way to a lot of nonsense where Bond drives a tank through St. Petersburg and outraces a speeding train. Crazy visuals are one thing, but Bond kills more Russians in this movie than he did in the whole series up to this point, and many of them are innocent patriots who merely get in his way. So much for the end of the Cold War!Director Martin Campbell, who would go on to unretire Bond more effectively a second time in the later \"Casino Royale\", fashions a clean visual look that gives the action sequences added oomph. There's some wheat among the chaff in terms of dialogue, though the writers overdo the humor probably trying to compensate for the previous Bond, Timothy Dalton, whose sober mien was (unfairly) criticized by many. Let's just say that our first image of Brosnan as Bond shouldn't be of him hanging upside down in a toilet stall, but it is.The Brosnan of \"GoldenEye\" presents us with a good actor and an electric screen presence, but he lacks the occasional deferential quality other Bond actors had; the ability to look at his situation with an encouraging shrug or wink that allowed you to feel some kind of bond with him. Brosnan's about coolness and distance, which detract somewhat from the generally decent \"GoldenEye\", and would become more of a problem in time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 21: I remember that a big fuss was made about this film when it first came out in 1995. It was supposed to usher in a whole new era of Bond adventures and Pierce Brosnan was much lauded as the best Bond of all time. But the years have not been kind to this film. After the admittedly impressive stunt-scene opening on the gigantic dam, it lapses into crudity and chaos, with an embarrassingly bad car chase thrown in for no reason, a cringeworthy script and a distinct lack of scene-setting for both our hero and his motivations. I admit it, I've been spoiled by Daniel Craig's outing CASINO ROYALE, which is at least three times as good as this effort.The good news is that the film improves somewhere after the outset, although it still feels disjointed and the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense. I appreciated the Russian villains, but the double-crossing plot is a bit lacklustre and Bond just seems to be in the right place at the right time all the while. I suppose you could say that believability is lacking. In the end, all the things that were wrong with Hollywood in the 1990s – lame humour, an emphasis on computer effects and spectacle over intricacy and tension, bloated running times and seen-it-all-before fatigue – are present here.Still, there are a few halfway decent action sequences to enjoy along the way. The big tank chase that occurs halfway through is the film's highlight, a masterpiece of technical skill, even if the tone varies wildly with unwelcome comedy popping up all the while. The movie also boasts a great villain in Sean Bean, sadly beginning his typecasting as a Hollywood bad guy that continues to this day. He's certainly better than the smarmy Brosnan, whose Bond is and will always be my least favourite of the various actors who've played the iconic spy over the years.I didn't really like Famke Janssen's wildly over-the-top femme fatale here. She's featured in an explicit sex scene that has no place in a Bond film and her mannerisms are completely over the top, cartoonish even. Still, there are some welcome faces in minor roles here, from larger-than-life Robbie Coltrane as a sinister contact and Tceky Karyo as a politician to Michael Kitchen as a nervous spy chief and Joe Don Baker as an ally. Desmond Llewelyn gets some genuine laughs in his appearance as Q and Judi Dench is excellent here as the ball-busting M. The less said about Alan Cumming, embarrassingly bad in one of those geeky hacker type roles, the better.\n",

            "Review 22: This is by far one of the best Bond films simply because it does not try to be a Bond film.  GoldenEye demonstrates an impressive independence that separates it from the tried-and-true-but-getting-boring Bond formula.  The one liners are not that great, but the action sequences are mindblowing. The chase scene is the best I have ever seen in any movie.  Period.  Purists will complain that there is a lack of gadgetry, but let them pout and go back to MacGyver reruns.  Possibility is not permissibility.  Just because Bond has a snazzy car does not mean that he has to utilize every perk that Q has included.  It is a relief that the writers did not force a new scene just to show off the car.  The movie does not need one, which helps it to maintain its quality as not just a Bond movie, but a high quality action movie that can stand on its own.  You will even find (gasp!) . . . character building!  There is actually dialogue between Q and Bond, instead of just a briefing and some commands.  Brosnan more than holds his own against past Bonds, and offers some of that GQ gentlemen element found missing in some of the past ones.  Bond fan, action fan, any fan, check this one out.  I even made my girlfriend watch it, and even she enjoyed it.  Chances are you will too.\n",

            "Review 24: Pierce Brosnan is outstanding as 007 in GOLDENEYE, but the film lacks the spirit of Timothy Dalton's two cracking adventures, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL. This film, alone, earned twice as much as those two and in a way it's sad because it shows that people are coming to watch Bond films that now concentrate on action, modern technology etc, than those which have these elements but still have a lot more in them. Timothy Dalton should return.\n",

            "Review 25: Perhaps the best part of this 130-minute film is the first 10.5 minutes. It's so spectacular that the rest of the film almost becomes a letdown.When I first saw this 10 years ago, I thought that opening action scene, capped by the most outrageous stunt I had seen to that point in film - Bond falling off a cliff and catching up in mid-flight to a falling airplane, landing in the cockpit and righting the plane - was, of course, ridiculous but great fun to watch.The rest of the film is more typical Bond silliness with far less spectacular scenes. When it comes to gadgets, sexual innuendos, unrealistic action with Bond escaping from impossible situations, lots of pretty women and exotic scenery to ogle, these James Bond films always give plenty of the above. Sad to say, in this film, the dialog is much dumber than usual and the fake Russian accents are hard to decipher which is very annoying.One good point: there is almost no profanity in this film, even minor stuff....but overall, it's just a \"fair\" Bond flick. decent but nothing to write home about, except to note that it was Pierce Brosnan's debut as Bond and he is fine in that role.\n",

            "Review 1: One of the greatest movie finale speeches ever, literal chills. The american president has always been a favorite of mine. The characters are well acted and quite lovely. The storyline is unique and has a good mix of heartfelt and comical. Endlessly rewatchable.\n",

            "Review 2: Aaron Sorkin sets a snappy pace for this classic romance/comedy/Cinderella Story, utilizing the White House, the President, and his staff as the conduit for his dialogue writing prowess.Clearly, this film helped influence the creation of 'The West Wing' TV Series four years later, even using the same Oval Office set shown in this film. The sets and atmosphere are presented in immaculate detail, and authentic looking, surpassing anything ever portrayed in film other than the Whitehouse itself. I've been in the real Whitehouse, including the Oval Office, and have also sat at the faux Resolute desk on the set of West Wing (same desk used in this film). There was a tremendous investment made to recreate the real thing in this film, and Reiner pulled it off perfectly.In Sorkin's screenplays, self-confidence, keen intellect, superior communication ability, and one's ethics-compass are at the core of the protagonist's persona.Michael Douglas portrays Democratic President Andrew Shepherd with the same believability and deft touch as he did playing Gordon Gecko in Wall Street.Annette Benning is the ideal girlfriend of the widowed Shepherd, and engages the audience (and Douglas) in one of her most charming performances.A first-class supporting actor ensemble are up to the task of portraying Sorkin's crack White House staff, adding immensely to making this film a feel-good romance that is believable and fun.The plot doesn't delve deeply into the emotions or feelings of Shepard nor Benning's lobbyist charecter Sydney Ellen Wade, but highlights the witty repertoire one would expect from a US President and Capitol Hill lobbyist. The deft skill and movie-star quality each actor has developed in their respective acting careers are showcased with Sorkin's writing in telling this Whitehouse Cinderella story.If the film went deep into emotions, it would have just gotten in the way of a story of a widowed relatively young President falling in love at first sight with Sydney, and the fun of seeing her being thrust into the White House staff and press fish bowl.There is a definite Frank Capra influence to the film.It all works better than it might seem on paper, and we get to enjoy another Rob Reiner classic: A director whose movie-making style and subject-matter is as diverse as anyone in the business.\n",

            "Review 3: The American President (1995)What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together).What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth.It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via \"West Wing\") he later becomes the president.But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, \"Love Actually,\" with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind.In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah.And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness.Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out.Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as \"Meathead\") in \"All in the Family.\" It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one.But here we have \"The American President,\" deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours.I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.\n",

            "Review 4: Is there a genre that Rob Reiner can't work in and make successful?  He captured comedy beautifully with The Sure Thing.  Music was brilliant with This is Spinal Tap.  Horror?  How about Misery?  Courtroom drama was awesome with A Few Good Men.  And now we have a political drama/comedy.  There is nothing this man can't do.This movie works inspite of people's claims that it is too political.  Well you know what, it's about the president of the United States of America, there's going to be a bit of poiltics in it.  And guess what, guns do kill people, so to have an issue at hand here that deals with gun control is applaudable.Okay, that's out of the way, let's talk about the film itself.  Because it is wonderful.  It is funny, well acted, and it is written with a good ear.The cast in this film is one to be envied by almost everyone except Oliver Stone and Robert Altman who seem to get everyone to do their films.  But here we have Douglas as the president, Sheen as his aid, Michael J. Fox, Samantha Mathis, Annette Bening as Sydney Ellen Wade and in my favourite performance, Richard Dreyfuss as the sniveling weasle Senator Bob Rumsen.As the story goes, the president's character gets questioned when he ( a widow ) finds a girlfriend in Sydney Wade.  The issues are handled wonderfully here.  Nothing is really tip-toed around as the script writer ( Aaron Sorkin ) writes a brave script about what is right and wrong with being the president and having a girlfriend.I personally liked the politics in the film.  I enjoyed how Shepherd decides to ignore the critisism leveled at him until the very end when he gives one of the best written speeches I've ever seen in film.  And when he flexes his authoritative muscles, you feel his power, you feel that the president has spoken.  And I was moved.  This is a great film and one that should be checked out for sure.****  I also found it to be interesting that the character in the film that tries to get the issue of gun control brought to the forefront is Michael J. Fox.  He is Canadian and we don't have problems with guns here.  Is it a coincidence ( probably ) that he was chosen to play this role?  Or was it done deliberately?  Interesting.\n",

            "Review 5: US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy.  Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist.  Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency.This is not exactely a political thriller.  In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine.  However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing.  However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing.  Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well.Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or \"oil baron\" Bush who would you pick?  Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do.  The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances.Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it.  Not brillant, but very enjoyable all the same.\n",

            "Review 7: Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely \"clued in\", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.\n",

            "Review 8: This is a great feel good movie about a charismatic, essentially very decent, fictional U.S. President, played by Michael Douglas in an extremely likable role. It's a political story as well as a love story. Douglas is both commanding & assured in his presidential role and charming & endearing in his romantic role. If anyone has not yet seen this movie, you'll discover you're in for an unexpected treat. There's something here for everyone...romance, comedy, politics, and drama. Andrew Shepherd is a youngish, popular President soon up for re election. Pressure is being put to bear on him to consolidate his administration's high poll ratings by pushing through a moderate crime bill which totally lacks Republican party support, yet is considered too weak by the Democrats. Meanwhile he finds himself attracted to Sydney Wade, an environmental lobbyist who is seeking legislation to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. Shepherd has been widowed for three years, and currently needs an escort for a State Dinner in honour of the President of France. He invites Sydney to this function and during this & subsequent encounters, the pair fall in love. Trouble ensues when Shepherd is torn between the politically expedient crime bill and the environmental legislation he has promised his new love interest. In terms of romance, there is the ongoing love story between the widowed President and the young lobbyist, Sydney, charmingly played by Annette Benning. This lovely and intelligent lady is quite smitten but at first obviously a bit overwhelmed by it all, feeling awkward and uncertain as the President's date. Sydney looks absolutely radiant at the state ball as she is swept off her feet by this handsome leader of the free world. Their chemistry proves to be electric, the dialogue clever, and the potential sexual situations quite tasteful by modern standards. Naturally the course of true love never does run smooth so it goes without saying that additionally, this unusual fishbowl courtship would have some unique problems as politics and public opinion intrude upon the couple's personal life.A certain built in comedy natural for a dating President makes this romance all the more enchanting. For instance, when Andrew attempts to buy his sweetheart some roses, can't you just imagine the national crisis that all but ensues? Despite his position as Head of State, Andrew likes to do his courting the old fashioned, personal way. During his initial phone call to Sydney, she believes he's one of her friends pulling a prank, which of course results in some hilarity.Naturally this tale is ripe with politics, and some reviewers even claim that the film is something of a precursor to TV's West Wing. Shepherd faces the dilemma of being forced to choose between the crime bill that his party is after him to push, versus Sydney's particular environmental cause. Not only party politics, but there is waning public support to consider. Needless to say, the President has no lack of advisers around who are more than eager to state their views, giving at times unsolicited advice. Martin Sheen plays his Chief of Staff and Michael J. Fox is cast as his Domestic Policy adviser. Shepherd must also contend with mud slinging by a nasty, unscrupulous rival Senator (portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss), who calls into question both Shepherd's family values and his girlfriend's activist past. By the way, any liberal political bias presented in this movie proved totally inoffensive to me. I definitely didn't sense that the producers had a nefarious grand agenda here.Drama wise, there's a touching, close relationship depicted between the President and his charming young teenage daughter, Lucy, and a definite sense of his loneliness following the death of his wife from cancer. Also, Shepherd is confronted with the choice of keeping his promise to Sydney versus salvaging his political career. His Oval Office moral dilemmas are not only relevant to the Presidency but can be extrapolated to any person in any career.This film delivers a powerful message about both personal and presidential integrity. At one point there's a moving speech that is inspiring for anyone, but may give American viewers in particular cause for reflection about the real significance of their country's Presidency and the qualities they might want to look for in the person elected to that office. Personally, I was practically ready to start flying the Stars and Stripes and I'm not even American! Whatever the nation involved, pity we don't have more Andrew Shepherds in political life today.\n",

            "Review 9: I don't mean that as a slam. I like Pretty Woman a lot, too. But this movie is my \"cure for all ills\" movie. The one I throw in the DVD player on rainy Sunday afternoons and crack out my best junk food. And the political setting seems to give it more meat.Michael Douglas is perfect. Annette Benning is perfect (and I would give anything to look as beautiful as she does in that blue dress at the State Dinner). Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen, Anna Devoure Smith. People being passionate about each other and about important issues and about doing the right thing. Everything about this movie lifts me up when I'm feeling down.\n",
            "I'm not a liberal, and I'm not a conservative - I fall somewhere in the middle. My beliefs in gun control to not include \"(getting) the guns\". But this movie is so good - that I can look past the occasional differences in political views. Those views are presented in a smart, thoughtful and constructive manner - and I appreciate them even though they are not my own.\n",
            "I enjoy this movie for what it is - a sweet, smart, funny movie set in one of the most \"romantic\" settings in the world - The White House.\n",

            "Review 10: Director Rob Reiner and Aaron Sorkin, fresh off their success with the film A Few Good Men, came up with this gem more then thirteen years ago. With a top notch cast and production values The American President is the continuation of an old Hollywood tradition of films where nobility wins out in the game of politics. While that might seem like a bad thing the fact is the film is all the better for it.First off there's the cast. Michael Douglas gives one of his finest performances as President Andrew Shepherd. The same can be said of his love interest and co-star Annette Benning in her performance as lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade. Together they have a strong chemistry whether it be the film's comedic, romantic or dramatic moments. Then there's the supporting cast. Martin Sheen, Anna Deavere Smith, Samantha Mathis, David Paymer and Michael J. Fox give fantastic performances as the White House staff with Sheen and Fox in particular getting moments to shine. Richard Dreyfuss gives a delicious performance as Presidential contender Bob Rumson. Even in the small roles the actors (like Joshua Malina and John Mahoney) give good performances.The film's production values are just as strong as its cast. The White House sets are excellent and give the feeling of being in the real place. The same can be said of virtually all the sets in the film. Also of special mention is the score by Marc Shaiman, especially in the opening credits of the film. Then there is the script by Arraon Sorkin. Sorkin's effortlessly blends together the elements of a good romantic comedy and a good political based film to create a hybrid of the two. Unlike other attempts at mixing comedy/satire with a political film that often end up failing to be successful as either (such as the more recent film Man of the Year for instance) here it works. In one scene you can have a speech about something political and have a romantic comedy scene the next. The result is that the styles don't clash but rather compliment each other nicely. It's easy to see where the genesis of Sorkin's later magnum opus The West Wing came from.The American President is a first rate film. With its top notch performances, excellent production values and a first rate script it's hard to beat that. The only shame of the film is the fact it didn't any major awards because it definitely deserved to.\n",

            "Review 11: I'm not usually the kind of person that enjoys a political film, but I found this film to very interesting, very fun and very entertaining.  Of course, this film is much more of a comedy/romance film than a political film, but nonetheless there are a great deal of political elements.  Some of the political aspects were strange and confusing, but that's just the nature of politics, is it not?The story is actually rather original (at least I think it is).  It's basically about a widower president that decides it's time to move on with his life and pursue other opportunities (if you catch my drift).  The story is very well done from start to finish and really has a lot of good things to say about politics, the media, relationships and what not.All the cast members involved did a fantastic job.  I'm not a huge fan of Michael Douglas (not really sure why) but he did a superb job and played a VERY likeable, fun president.  Someone that you would really like to know. Martin Sheen also played an extraordinary Chief of Staff for the president and also played a very likeable guy.  Michael J. Fox did an excellent job with a role that I didn't expect great things from.  Michael deserves a great deal of credit for his role in this film.  Annette Bening...WOW!  She did a great job with her role and looks better than ever throughout the entire film.  I really liked her character, she also played a very warm and likeable character.  Samantha Mathis had a somewhat small role in the film, but nonetheless a very important one.  She really did a great job with her role and also looks fantastic throughout the film.  Finally, Richard Dreyfuss.  He also played a very small role, but an extremely important role and did a great job.  While he wasn't a very likeable character (he wasn't supposed to be liked), he played it perfectly.  Some other great supporting cast members include David Paymer, Anne Haney, Nina Siemaszko, Wendie Malick, and John Mahoney.I should also mention director Rob Reiner.  This guy is just great, he really does a fantastic job directing his films.  This is another great film to add to his already impressive list of credits.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes light-hearted comedies and/or just romantic comedies.  This really is an excellent film and ought to be seen.  I hope that you will enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris\n",

            "Review 12: Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term.But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition.The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film.I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living.The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 13: \"The American President\" was the source of the later dramatic television series success \"The West Wing\". Apparently, statist influencers in the U.S. have become so successful at warping the real by \"spin\" that many people could not understand this seminal film, especially those incompetent reviewers who masquerade as professional critics. It is by any standard of reason I suggest 1. authentic in its meticulously presented milieu, characters and dialogue, 2. an appealing classically romantic comedy and 3. a wonderfully satiric juxtaposition between the American--the self-responsible--qualities of even a president and his vulnerability to pseudo-religious moralizing attacks as he tries to access his individual rights in a nation gone constitutionally insane under the urging of Postmodernists. All this widower president wants at the beginning is a date with a feisty environmental lobbyist; later he wants her as a girl friend, and vice versa, with a a chance to explore their growing relationship. This simple human dignity is compromised as a right by the opposition party's leading candidate, who uses innuendo and false headlining to undermine the man's public popularity and threaten two vital bills both the president and the lobbyist are trying to get through a stone-walling Congress. Rob Reiner directs in a serious and lyrical way dialogue and character revelations that in lesser hands might have been slow or worse; in my judgment the pace never falters for an instant. Aaron Sorkin 's memorable script takes in issues, personalities, levels of relationship and supervision that I believe were both difficult and rewarding with uncommon precision and skill. As the \"American\"--individual, realist, pro- rights--president, Michael Douglas achieves award level simplicity and command at the same time, something which he had been growing toward for two decades. Only players with shorter roles--John Mahoney, and White House staffers--are really exactly right in their roles; but the clarity of the characters presented in the film's script is so strong, owing the the power of the central character and his categorical value of individualism, that sincere performances become exceptional. Annette Benning is attractive and passable as the lobbyist--first girl friend; Martin Sheen is acceptable as Douglas's aide; but no one is outstandingly good I claim nor unacceptable; their believability I suggest is produced by the ideas and values they are representing. Michael J. Fox's speech level is inadequate as the committed, immature aide; Samantha Mathis and Shawna Waldron and Leon Kodak, Anna Deavere Smith, Richard Dreyfuss, Gail Strickland, and many others get small telling moments; the film centers so well I claim on the president and his lady that all else become background, mosaic pieces in a larger picture, observing, relating to, or commenting on the main thrust of action--a president doing his job and asking his rights. This centrality leading to unforgettable scenes is a quality only the best films possess--\"The Guns of Navarone\", \"The Fountainhead\", \"Gone With the Wind\" and \"Bend of the River\", for instance. In a comedy, this is a rare achievement therefore. Marc Shaiman's music is unobtrusive and occasionally moving; Gloria Gresham's costumes and the production design by Lilly Kilvert aid the film's hard-won credibility. Cinematography by John Seale and Art Direction by John Warnke are outstandingly believable. I suggest the producers Charles Newirth, Rob Reiner, Barbara Maltby and Jeffrey Stott have achieved something as rare here as was achieved in \"An Affait to Remember\", \"The Bridal Path\", \"You Came Along\" and \"Operation Petticoat\" and other service-based idea-level satires--something lasting, emotionally satisfying and unusually profound for any genre.\n",

            "Review 14: Michael Douglas, who is most well known for his enormous skill in playing stolid villains or regular men who become desperate because they manage to get themselves in way over their head, puts off these characteristics to play the part of the President of the United States, and he delivers a towering performance in this role. The story is based on the fact that President Andrew Shephard (Douglas) will soon be facing reelection, an election which may be compromised by the fact that he is developing a romantic interest in an envorinmental lobbyist named Sydney Ellen Wade (played beautifully by Annette Bening). Matters are complicated by the fact that Shephard's wife died just before he was elected in the first place, and his cabinet members (particularly Lewis Rothschild, played by Michael J. Fox) are urgently trying to persuade him not to date during the election.One of the strange things about this movie is that it's kind of ironic that no one has really made a political film like this that centers around a romance involving the President. Indeed, watching a man as powerful as the U.S. President using his powers to flirt with someone that he has a crush on (okay, that sounded pretty dumb. Maybe no one's done it before because it sounds ridiculous in writing!), trying at the same time to persuade her that he really is the President. While it doesn't exactly SOUND like it would make the greatest film, this premise has resulted in the exceedingly superior romantic comedy that we see in The American President.\n",
            "The performances in the film are spectacular throughout, but it's actually the script that deserves even more attention than the actors' performances, which is a rare distinction in a film. I think that the reason that The American President succeeds so well as a political film as well as a romantic comedy is that both elements are so realistically presented. I think it was Roger Ebert who praised The American President for approaching and handling real issues, such as gun control and the environment, instead of side-stepping this and trying to present a President who is not taking any certain stands on any certain issues that might cause the film's audience to like him or the movie less.  The love story, one of the easiest things in the cinematic medium to completely screw up, is done brilliantly here, largely because of the occupations of the two subjects that it centers on as well as the excellent script. The movie has a nearly endless amount of comments to make about the American Presidency, the way that the public sees the office, and the restrictions that it places on its occupants. There is a pleasant irony between such things as President Shephard's ability to get Wade on the phone when she doesn't even have a phone of her own (hey, I'm a poet and I didn't even realize it), but his complementary inability to even bring her to the house for a nice, innocent dinner. President Andrew Shephard is faced with the unfortunate task of trying to appease the American public, retain his position in the White House, convince Sydney Ellen Wade that he is who he says he is and that he is genuinely interested in her, and provide for his own romantic happiness, with the added conflict that if any one of them fails, all of the others are likely to fail as well. It's true that, this being a rather light-hearted romantic comedy, we already know how the film is going to end, but brilliant dialogue, a fascinating story, unusually interesting characters, and a tense political atmosphere prevent the material from getting boring just because we really already know how it's going to turn out in the end. Besides that, the romance in the film is so well done that that element alone makes it worth watching. There's a scene in the film when President Shephard and Wade are dancing in a crowded dinner hall, and she asks him what people are going to think about the whole situation, wondering who that woman is and why the President is dancing with her. In an example of the brilliance of the script as well as the reason that the romantic plot of the film succeeds so well, Shephard responds, `Sydney Ellen Wade, because she said yes.'  You see, romance CAN be done right sometimes.\n",

            "Review 15: This film worked for the same reason the West Wing works... it humanizes the President.  Yes, the most powerful man in the world has feelings and falls in love.  I liked one reviewer's comment saying that this film is Capra-esque.  It certainly is because of its overall feel-good aspect and optimism.  I enjoyed this film, and Michael Douglas seldom disappoints me. 8/10.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 16: No offence to Michael Douglas but I'm not a fan of his movies but in The American President I thought he was brilliant and enjoyed watching him in the movie. He makes the character very charming, warm and compassionate.This film was really the first to show the audience an insight into The White House and what it is like for the President, all the problems and dilemmas he has to go through and the expectations ordinary people have for their elected officials. In this film, Michael Douglas plays the President who has a daughter and has had to juggle his job with raising his daughter after his wife died and the public have been sympathetic to him but a threat comes along in the guise of Sydney Ellen Wade played by Annette Bening who Andrew Shepherd takes an interest in and wants to have a relationship with but soon the relationship is under scrutiny and everything from his and her pasts are used to undermine them.What I find interesting about the film is that American schools teach their students about their government. I think the UK is lacking in this as there is no effort to teach kids about their government and as a result they don't care about politics and that is a shame.The film is intelligent and yet Rob Reiner does it in such a way that anyone can understand what is being said and you don't need to have an degree to gasp what lies beneath the words.Richard Dreyfuss plays a right pantomime villain in this, I found myself hissing at him every time he came on the screen and he really played him well as this smug, unscrupulous person who uses muck to discredit Shepherd's character but can't discredit the president's policies.Annette Bening is just great in this. She is funny and beautiful and has some of the most amusing scenes. Scenes such as her trying to walk out the wrong door in the oval office and not knowing the President was on the phone and her thinking it was a prank.I have to say I love Michael J. Fox in this, Personally, I think he had some of the best lines in the film. His character looks up to the President and you see him wanting his idol to speak up and tell the American people the way it is and not the way Rumson is telling it.Martin Sheen is the President's adviser in this and then went on to become the President in The West Wing.A fine cast, inspiring writing especially at the end and a talented director made this film so popular with the audience.\n",

            "Review 17: This film sees the best acting from Michael Douglas (my God, he isn't a villain), Annette Bening (power woman), Michael J Fox (finally not a teen) and Martin Sheen (oh so amusing).  This is such a warm film.  It is innocent yet powerful. And the humour is second to none.  Just fabulous.\n",

            "Review 18: This Reiner flick is a gem of the nineties. In its genre probably the best thing to hit the screens since Capra rounded  them up over half a century ago.The story itself is nothing extraordinary. Set in Washington it is a simple tale of love between lobbyist Sidney Wade and widow President Andrew Sheperd. Flung into love they both encounter obstacles as both opposition and political differences tear them apart. No need to worry though, all is well that ends well. And Reiner is not the one to slip one on us.What makes this film shine above most are not the development of characters or the underdeveloped political statements. Its the achievement of giving audiences 90 minutes of pure bliss. Douglas is lovable as president, Beattys spouse makes you jealous as always, J. Fox never misses an opportunity to display huge talent and Dreyfuss is just the kind of guy you love to hate. Add a dose of victorious political correctness and top it of with a final speech that raises the hair on any kinds of neck but rednecks, and you got your evening made.Enjoy !\n",

            "Review 19: .....than this, despite the three f-bombs that are dropped in the last half hour of the film. And the emotional situation that was taking place, makes it understandable. THIS is what we need for a President. Especially when Louis, an AWESOME performance by Michael J Fox, tells the president off. Why? Because, as a citizen, this is HIS President! The president in this country works for us. And guess what the problems are? Crime and the environment. And this movie was made in 1995!!! almost 30 years ago. Annette Bening is Sydney, the President's girlfriend, who is a powerful lobbyist. She is very passionate about her job. But then their jobs clash. In the end the President's last words to Sydney are, \"Well, it turns out, I've got a rose garden.\" Michael Douglas, if only we were all still 30 younger. Anyway, you get the picture, he does the right thing in the end. If you haven't seen this film, see it. Oh and a shout out to Martin Sheen, as the Cheif of staff. Please! See it. It's sort of a Cinderella story, and yes, it's fiction. But still......dot dot dot!!!!😔😔😔\n",

            "Review 20: The writing is sharp, though you can tell Sorkin hadn't quite mastered his style. The story is actually pretty reasonable and makes for an interesting film. Michael Douglas is excellent as the president and you can see the model from which Sorkin would craft Josiah Bartlet. All in all, this is a decent diversion and I enjoyed most of it.\n",

            "Review 21: First: Michael J. Fox steals this movie. Louis' dialogue toward the end, when he lectures the president, is to me the heart of this movie.You can tell this is a work of fiction because this is a president with backbone, willing to scrap a major item on his agenda and redo it. That kind of political courage does not exist in these modern days.I've watched this movie several times in the past year, and while I think it's very well done, it also makes me sad. Sad that we don't have people with this kind of courage and values leading our nation.\n",

            "Review 22: The American President (1995)3.5/4\"The American President\" follows President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas), preparing for re-election. To help his campaign, he and his campaign bring in Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening), a small, mainly unknown and struggling environmental activist. At first, she's opposed to him, but eventually, he begins to fall for him, and slowly, she does, too. Their relationship is controversial, though, as it soon becomes a main perception of Shepherd, and it causes both ups and downs.The story is very good. It's a great Capra-esque romance; it's an old fashioned sort of Hollywood movie that is as well made as the classics. I enjoyed their love story, and Fox's and Bening's chemistry is superb. The movie was written by the great Aaron Sorkin, and the screenplay is extraordinary. I loved his screenplay and vision very much.The film was also directed by Rob Reiner, who is right at home with this sort of feel good material. It's well directed, and it even made me remember \"When Harry Met Sally...\" which is just as good. His lighthearted comic touch is perfect. But what is most shocking to me is this is the movie he made after the wretched \"North\" and shows me that he still had it.This is a very good movie, entertaining and fantastical as it is well made and well done. I enjoyed it very much, because of Douglas, Bening, Sorkin's screenplay and Reiner's wonderful direction. It's a fun movie.\n",

            "Review 23: \"The American President\" can stand alone for its cinematic charms, with sharp script and strong performances, and also for its ability to connect to a typical moviegoer.  This is one movie I can remember that really brings the daily goings-on in the White House seem like daily grind rather than grand drama where huge decisions are made and enormous events occur all the time--granted whatever is decided and happens in the White House is indeed huge and enormous, but the film doesn't inflate it to some elitist/exclusive point of view.And while the movie can be enjoyed purely for its cinematic value, what I do appreciate about this film is that it does make good, valid points about American politics and the presidency of the United States.  President Andrew Sheppard (played by Michael Douglas) engages in several conversations and even arguments about what it means to be in his position and how that affects the way he serves his constituents, the American public.  His last speech rings true; besides his views that favor obviously to the left of the political spectrum, he makes honest comments about how politicians win elections and how that affects their ability to do their job.I consider this movie to be a basic cinematic course in understanding the American Presidency and political elements that invariably surround it.  It may come off as a left-wing, liberally biased film, but it makes no confusion about the fact that whether they are Democrats or Republicans, politicians have their flaws and unscrupulous methods of keeping their position of power, including the President himself.  It is one of my favorite movies, and I give it a 10/10.\n",

            "Review 24: This is so Liberal it's sickening. I mean, I've come to expect a little left-wing propaganda in most films from Hollywood, but to this degree?!Two hours of Liberal preaching are capped off in the U.S. President's final speech of the movie, in which he proclaims how \"proud\" he is to be a card-carrying member of the ACLU!!! Ha ha. I guess we all supposed to be cheering at that point. Personally, I reached for the nearest barf bag.This movie is simply director Rob Reiner's propaganda piece for his agenda. Being a \"card-carrying\" member of the ultra-Left People For the American Way, Reiner shows us a charming, loving portrait of a President that somehow reminds us of Bill Clinton, if he were a bachelor.Can you imagine if someone was this heavy-handed on the Right and tried to make a similar movie?? Never happen. For one thing, the critics would tear it apart, which they didn't dare do with this piece of slick celluloid brainwashing.\n",

            "Review 25: Aaron Sorkin's script and pitch-perfect performances by Annette Bening and Michael Douglas create a funny and ultimately poignant movie that makes a viewer happy to be an American.Douglas portrays a flawed but deeply honest president who knows how to learn from his mistakes. He conducts himself with dignity. Bening is a political lobbyist with a strong commitment to the environment. (Interesting that a film made 23years ago outlines environmental issues more clearly than they would be articulated today!) How can a relationship develop between two people given their very different positions in the political life of the country? How they work through these issues goes from humorous to dramatic and, of course, a happy ending.All the minor characters are well fleshed out. In particular, Martin Sheen as Chief of Staff wants happiness for his old friend, but is very aware of the poltiical realities involved. Michael J. Fox wants the president to be the best man he can be, wants him to live up to the highest values of the office.Watching this film, I am struck by the ability of the Office of the President to create positive change in this world. I hope we can see this reflected at the White House once again some day.\n",

            "Review 1: This is one of the best films of the 90's hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew \"Ace\". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I've read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this \"Goodfells Part 2\". Is it \"Goodfellas Part 2\", in my opinion, no. Yes, it's very similar situations, but it's not the same plot. It's a little more gory and more bright. \"Casino\" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro's character says \"It's more like Disney Land now\". Actually that's true, it's not like it used to be. I'm only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60's and 70's. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta's in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I'm a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He's dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he's a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He's only 5' 6'', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. \"You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!\" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we're talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my \"Rober DeNiro: A history of his films\" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has \"hired\" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace \"I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!\", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I'm telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song \"Gimme Shelter\" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I'm disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. \"Casino\" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don't compare this to \"Goodfellas\", let it stand on it's own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It's very violent, we're talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there's more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It's a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I'd like to see it in the top 100, but we'll see. 10/10\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 2: I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching \"Casino\" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas' top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you'd expect with a Joe Pesci character, he's a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn't mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you'll have to see for yourself.The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than \"Goodfellas\"...also with the same stars and same director. This is because \"Goodfellas\" was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas \"Casino\" seemed to have more story and wasn't always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a 'nice' picture. It's filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn't really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 3: I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws.Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob's casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There's divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky's wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don't change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can't turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace's fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man's escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.4/4\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 4: A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the \"blue collar\" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.\n",

            "Review 5: Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese \"Casino\" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tablesBut he had a fatal flaw 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money 'Ace' knew that but he didn't careWhat he wanted was to marry her Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desiresJoe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.) To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcerThe clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 6: I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the \"great film\" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.\n",
            "Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of \"Satisfaction\" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, \"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies\" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 7: Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an \"I'm a schmo\" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's \"Go Your Own Way\" and The Animals' \"The House of the Rising Sun\" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie \"Heat\". On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It's an entertaining ride, but it's one that is ultimately shallow.\n",

            "Review 8: If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 9: As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a \"moneymaker\" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.If you are a gambler or know the \"wiseguy\" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the \"old school\" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).\n",

            "Review 10: I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 11: Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film\n",

            "Review 12: Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a amazing movie with unforgettable performances.The film portrays Las Vegas at a time when it was dominated by the mafia, extremely well directed by Scorsese, that film shows Robert De Niro as manager of the Tangiers Casino who have to deal with his unstable wife that used to be a high-class prostitute but who can not forget her pimp Lester and with his childhood friend Nicky that is taking the city with extreme uncontrolled violence bringing a bad image to the plans that the mafia has in Las Vegas.Sharon Stone definitely give the best performance of her career in this film and the secondary characters convey very well the image of the great leaders of the mafia.Casino is a classic and a must-see movie.\n",

            "Review 13: Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.But I don't think that Casino is at all a \"perfect\" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.Casino is based on the story of Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein \"secretly\" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded \"mix tape\" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all.\n",

            "Review 14: The opening 30 minutes or so of \"Casino\" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist—nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero—providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film \"The Departed\" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece \"GoodFellas,\" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of—I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress—but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in \"Casino.\" So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie—the middle in particularly—really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.I wish that \"Casino\" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from \"GoodFellas,\" seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.I admired the physical production values of \"Casino\" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing.\n",

            "Review 15: Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying. This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen.\n",

            "Review 16: Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in \"Goodfellas,\" but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their \"Goodfellas\" roles. Stone is alluring.\n",

            "Review 17: Nothing you haven't seen before, Robert De Niro performs in a similar style to several he established his career playing and Joe Pesci can only play himself no matter what the role calls for. If organised crime capers are your thing, or you're a casino denizen, it's lucky 7s all round for you, although, on this occasion, it's complemented and elevated through an outstanding performance by Sharon Stone. She steals the picture as the addicted to anything femme fatale opportunist most men would aspire to tame and, if they did get that chance, they would soon discover the trophy wife from hell - Sam did, but don't let that put you off.\n",

            "Review 18: ...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple. Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters. It just has so much going for it that Goodfellas did not.\n",

            "Review 19: While re-watching \"Casino\" just now I kept thinking of Spielberg's words re: Kubrick. \"Just try to stop watching one of Stanley's movies when you've already started,\" he said. \"It's impossible\".Perhaps, with Kubrick's passing, Scorsese became the greatest filmmaker on the planet. \"Casino\" is just an unbridled jolt of cinema, a three hour movie that feels like an hour and a half, a breakneck pace that still allows for rare depth in its performances and characterisations. It's the best performance Sharon Stone ever put in; after the ridiculous \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Sliver\", they could have written her off if not for this. Her character's arc is tremendous.More than anything, \"Casino\" is a showcase of what Pauline Kael called \"film sense\", that implacable quality that all great directors have. Like Spielberg and Kubrick, Scorsese has a gift for knowing exactly what shot should follow which, is an absolute master of camera movements, angles, framing such that the movie streaks across the screen like fast-moving water over rocks, never once stalling or slowing down.It's brilliant, but it's not up with the director's greatest work like \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\", or \"Hugo\", which is a truly underrated masterpiece. It's a notch below, but when Scorsese is a notch below his best, he's still streets ahead of everybody else.\n",

            "Review 20: I still remember watching Casino as a 12 year old on New Year's Day back in 1997 and being captivated from start to finish. I was lucky to be watching Casino at that age considering that the film is rated R 18+ in Australia for Medium Level Violence and Medium Level Coarse Language. Thankfully my Dad was lenient as long as we were sensible as myself, my Dad and my brother sat together and watched the movie. Casino was and still is a brilliant movie. Martin Scorsese directed another top notch film. The all star cast was perfect. Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese mark another collaboration after their success with the classics Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), New York, New York (1977), The King of Comedy (1983), and Cape Fear (1991). Also joining in the collaboration is Joe Pesci of whom the three actors united for Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990) and The Irishman (2019).Set in Las Vegas during the 1970's, Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro in another brilliant role) is in charge of the mafia connected Tangiers Casino to oversee its day to day operations. Sam is successful in turning the casino into a legitimate profitable venture as well as skimming some of the profits to the mafia. His legitimate lifestyle is put in jeopardy after he marries former hustler and prostitute Ginger (Sharon Stone in an Academy Award nominated performance) who turns out to be unstable and dishonest as she leads a self destructive lifestyle with alcohol and drugs as Sam continues to shower her with diamonds, fur coats, money and other expensive gifts along with access to a safety disposit box. Another huge threat in Sam's life is Chicago mafia enforcer and childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci in another terrific performance) whose volatile behaviour earns him a ban from every casino in Las Vegas as he forms a crew and commits various crimes including robbery and burglary as well as beating, threatening and killing people. Nicky's actions bring a lot of unwanted attention to Sam due to their lifelong friendship. Ginger continues to see her ex boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods) who is a pimp and con artist yet is nothing more than a loser who is always asking Ginger for money. Though Sam organises to have Lester beaten up as a warning to stay away from his wife, Lester still pops up and continues to act as a leach. Marrying Ginger and bringing Nicky to Las Vegas would turn out to be Sam's downfall.The all star cast also includes Kevin Pollak, L. Q. Jones, Dick Smithers and the late actors Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, and Alan King.Director Martin Scorsese as always does an amazing job as he brought to life a classic movie based on Nicholas Pileggi's nonfiction novel Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.Casino is an extremely violent movie with several scenes that are quite unsettling and not for the faint hearted. The \"f\" is used 422 times throughout the whole movie.I loved Casino when I first saw it and to this day, it deserves a spot as one of my top 10 movies of all time. It is 178 minutes long, but is a movie that I still cherish.A well deserved 10/10.\n",

            "Review 21: I love Casino especially if I watch it from the beginning. Robert DeNiro should have won an Academy AWard for this performance along with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. The film is perfectly entertaining about casinos before it became Disneyland. There were other great performances by Don Rickles, Alan King, etc. The film is a Martin Scorsese film with two of his favorite actors--Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci giving Oscar performances. The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods' performance as Ginger's pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really don't want it to end because it's that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pesci's character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and it's connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But it's that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film. I always look forward to seeing it on the cable stations. Of course, Ace and Nicky's friendship is the crutch of this film.\n",

            "Review 22: A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad? People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a \"scumbag\" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing. On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!\n",

            "Review 23: \"A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.\"I learned three things from Casino: running a casino is a tough business, Las Vegas is a complicated town, and a terrible wife makes life much harder. Casino is a lengthy movie about the rise and fall of a couple of Vegas big-shots, and  the loss of the essence of old-school Vegas, itself. The story is told primarily from the points of view of Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niero) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), two guys who have known each other for years, and come to make money in Vegas in very different ways.Sam is a genius at all aspects of gambling that's tapped by the mob bosses back east to run a casino for them, while Nicky is a muscle guy who's there to protect Sam's operation. We watch them make a lot of money, and get into a lot of trouble because of their respective weaknesses/excesses. It's an entertaining movie, and the 179 minute runtime will pass by pretty quickly.Both De Niro and Pesci were excellent, with many other great actors supporting their performances. A lot of your enjoyment of this movie will hinge on your preference for the genre. Casino is very much a mob-type movie, though it's not a Godfather Part II Las Vegas re-tread, by any means. If even someone like me who's not a particular fan of this kind of movie can enjoy it, then that's a promising sign that most others will enjoy it, too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 24: During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's \"Casino\" is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in \"Casino\", I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film. When Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is put in charge of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us. However, his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) is not fond of legitimacy; and when he settles in Vegas to protect him, it's not long until he starts doing some business of his own. As Nicky himself puts it: \"The dollarAlways the dollar\". But if we go back, Nicky also expresses at the beginning: \"It was perfect. Sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me, his best friend, and Ginger, the woman he loved\". We see Ginger (a monumental Sharon Stone) at first as Sam sees her, a light in the middle of the room (there's one scene where this translates literally in images, with Robert Richardson's cinematography-that contains a wonderful use of light-putting the rest of the room in a mild darkness, while De Niro stands in awe as Stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light), but she is actually the most complex character of the film.If you approach \"Casino\" as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs (a subject the film manages perfectly), you may not notice the complexity of Stone's character and her performance. But then, if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life, you might miss the best element of the film: Joe Pesci's creation of Nicky; something that's indeed better than his work in \"Goodfellas\".Ultimately, you may choose to take \"Casino\" as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life. Again, this (as the marriage thing) is a subject that the film dominates. That's how brilliant Nicholas Pilleggi's-together with Scorsese-adaptation of his own book is; it covers everything with every detail. They did the same thing with \"Goodfellas\" and it was so rich that you could get lost in the 'mafia' universe. Here, as in \"Goodfelas\" (both film share many similarities, more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves, about how great both movies are and that these similarities don't change that fact at all), you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie. It's the only way you'll enjoy the many conversations between Sam and Nick that lie between the best of the film and, besides showing that De Niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision; but Pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble (also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure), are crucial to its development. The narration comes and goes during the film, in present or past time, generating more confusion for the viewer. This is all after the first hour and a half, and if you're not hypnotized by the film's spell at that point, something must be wrong. Is the movie too long? Yes, if the spell didn't work on you; but if you're already connected with the characters and don't want to get out, it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours.\n",

            "Review 25: Enough rehash already! Although not a remake in the traditional sense, \"Casino\" is a virtual re-presentation of Martin Scorcese's '91 smash \"Goodfellas\". Now that was a great gangster film. Graphically violent, self absorbed, bitingly funny, brooding and epically proportioned, it was a knockout. Not so \"Casino\".This is a real exercise in excess, and one that completely backfires on Scorcese and his team. The film is terribly overlong at three hours, and many will struggle to pay attention the entire time, especially given the narrative which has leads De Niro, Pesci and others talking us through the whole show, another big miscalculation.The movie is far too violent, being often hard to stomach rather than effectively portraying the characters and their personalities and motivations. It's just one long, drawn out gangster show set in Las Vegas that is spotted with bursts of gruesome violence. In short, Scorcese and co-writer Pileggi have used exactly the same formula that they employed in adapting the latter's first book \"Wise Guys\" (\"Goodfellas\") to the screen, which made that film a sensation, and this one a mindless bore.Performances are strong, especially Sharon Stone as the hopeless drug fiend Ginger whose love of money proves her undoing. She is well deserving of the Oscar nomination that has come her way. De Niro and Joe Pesci, though impressive, are really only reprising their original \"Goodfellas\" turns. De Niro's Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway is very similar to his Sam Rothstein, the Jewish gambling icon who ran \"The Tangiers\" for the mob. And Pesci's Nicky Santoro, the ultra-violent, crazy mob guy assigned to look after Rothstein, is a dead ringer for Tommy De Vito, his violent, paranoid persona from \"Goodfellas\". Other support players make the most of their limited roles.Definitely under edited, tale could have been told in less than two hours, but Scorcese had to over indulge didn't he. Robert Richardson's camera work is impressive, though even he seems to be trying too hard. Perhaps that's just the whole feel of the movie. An over-rated, over the top, over inflated waste. Art and sets are incredibly lavish, while the costumes are wild but spot on. PS I bet Pileggi's book is great reading.Sunday, March 24, 1996 - Knox District Centre\n",

            "Review 1: Wow, here's an emotional story that gets you involved and wears you out by the end. I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals.Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson (see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End). Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it. It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing, too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom, Titantic.One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British, you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England, in which this story takes place.The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen, on both the inside and outside scenes. It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score, too.This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection. It''s great film-making.\n",

            "Review 2: Whoever says they just don't make the quality of pictures today that they used to hasn't seen or is ignoring this film.That Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actresses working is no secret. But who would have expected such a miracle from her in the screenwriting department? Some of the most dramatic moments in 'Sense and Sensibility' come from her pen, not Jane Austen's, difficult as that may be to believe. For instance, the scene in which Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) carries in the ill Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet), echoing the earlier scene where Willoughby (Greg Wise) brought the injured young woman home was Thompson's doing. Marianne's illness also is responsible for much more drama in the movie than in the book. And I'm an Austen fan! I can't recall another writer bringing so much good of his or her own to a classic like this.I suppose the director, cinematographer, production designer, etc. deserve to share the credit when a movie is this outstanding, but with such a super group of actors on the screen (from top to bottom) it's easy to heap all the praise on them. I had unconsciously (and unfairly) pigeonholed Alan Rickman based on the other role I'd seen him in, the villain in 'Die Hard,' so he was quite a surprise to me. The real bombshell, however, was my first exposure to Kate Winslet. After seeing this movie and Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' I can say I can't remember another young actress who has impressed me so much. And she played these difficult roles by the time she was 20! Many of the other cast members are a part of an excellent group that Thompson and Branagh have often worked with in the past.I realized that 'S&S' had become one of my all-time favorite movies when I found myself watching it every chance I got when it came on TV. I think it's bumped 'Raging Bull' off my personal top 10 list.\n",

            "Review 3: What an excellent film! Superb performances, spellbinding dialogue, and beautiful sets and props led to an enchanting 2 hours of lost love and hope. I loved the stiffly formal, wonderfully polite, yet stifling mores these English were forced to endure. In many cases their lives were not their own to live; in many, their lives were lived under the gun of the almighty buck. They carried right on, however, with their characteristically stiff English upper lip, come what may. Great film with a knockout ending.\n",

            "Review 4: I haven't read the book (yet), but concerning the film as it is, I can assure you that it is very well made. You'll get one of the best period dramas (I wouldn't go all the way with \"best ever\", but then again, I don't often use extremes to describe a movies) that you have seen! Of course you have to be open to this kind of movie. Meaning, that if you're more likely to watch Bruce Willis in Die Hard or can't wait for the next Steven Seagal movie, this might not be your cup of tea! There is a strong possibility that you won't like (to watch) this movie at all.So if you have seen period dramas and like them, than watch this one too, if you haven't watched one yet, than this can be a perfect movie to start with (although some might say, it's downhills after that ;o) )\n",

            "Review 5: If it wasn't for Jane Austen's novels and their screen-adaptation, we wouldn't be much familiar with the English gallantry and the bourgeois manners of the early 19th century. Her oeuvre encapsulated a time where women didn't have a way to go through life without landing on the \"marriage\" square, hardly an issue to please feminists but who would call Austen traditional or submissive for all that? She respected the conventions but made powerful social commentaries in the indirect sense that her female protagonists never married someone they didn't love. Marriage was the end, but love was the means to achieve it, while marriage of convenience was the privilege of the mediocre ones.Now, there is an interesting point of comparison between her two most celebrated novels: \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\". \"Sense\" was Austen's first success, written at a very young age, yet it deals with characters evolving in the realm of adulthood, while in \"Pride\", written by an older Austen, the heroines are the Bennett Sisters who aren't older than twenty. It is just like Austen was a painter who had to go to the top of the mountain to have a clear view on a plain after having painted the mountain from the plain. With enough experience and wisdom, she was able to make a brighter portrait of a young generation who get the man through their actions. In \"Sense\", the Dashwood sisters are fully-dimensional characters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) is reserved and introverted while Marianne (Kate Winslet) is romantic and flamboyant, they're more mature than the Bennetts sisters, but at the expense of their reactivity.In \"Pride\", luck and men's valiance were not elements to count on, and many round trips allowed the heroine to confront her suitor. It is possible that \"Pride\" was a bit too modern while \"Sense\" was more obedient to the perception of women's role at the time (rather static), but the directing by Ang Lee and the screenplay worked in such a way that the quest for marriage isn't actually the most interesting part of the film. And while I don't think I give away the ending by saying that each one will find the true love, it's obviously not the point of suspense; the real question is how these people interact. And just like your typical Austen's stories, there's a good deal of passions and deception, or romantic studs popping up at the right moment and forcing the women to all align in the house to promptly welcome their host. Some are dark and brooding (Alan Rickman) other shy and amiable (Hugh Grant) and a few too perfect to be true (Greg Wise) but they all have one thing in common, they're conveniently called to office in London whenever marriage seems too close, a snobby bitch or karma playing the same game postponing the overdue rendezvous with destiny.But as predictable as these films are, their quality is elsewhere, starting with the acting. Literary movies have this quality that the abundance of words and plots can sometimes distract from simpler moments that actually elevate them more than any monologue or speech. This moment occurs when Edward (Grant), is ready to confess something to Elinor. They have spent enough time together to grow a deep feeling. He's about to say something about his you expect the word \"feeling\", he says \"education\", and you can see something click in the blink of an eye in Thompson's face, 'devastation' as it would really show in a woman who learned to hide her feelings. There's no doubt that Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actress of her generation. On the other hand, Marianne will also face abandon and the reaction will fit her passionate personality. While, the plot in itself can be summed up by women waiting for the right men to come, so (God forbid), they don't end up as bitter spinster, there is more to enjoy, the text and more importantly, the subtext.And on that level, Jane Austen's stories are exhilarating hymns for eloquence and literacy, whether when the characters write intimate correspondences, share their personal thoughts with their friends or relatives or try to convey a strong message by still respecting the conveniences, I just can't resist by the way Shakespeare's language is being honored. You finish the film and you just want to express your feelings with the same economy of obviousness or flamed passion when called for, and a similar urge generally invade me when I finish the Ivory and Merchant movies. There is something just irresistible in these British heritage films, they make you realize how close we still are to these times by the scale of history, but light-years ahead as far as mediocrity and plainness is concerned.And it's a credit to Austen's writing and Thompsons's rewriting (earning her an Oscar) to have translated the story in a tone that wouldn't make feminists' neck hair stand up and wouldn't portray men as misogynistic pigs.The film says something important: the strength of your character doesn't depend on what he or she accomplishes but how it can strongly affect your own feeling or how can they resist the cruelties of life without necessarily triumphing over them. All through the film, I was totally rooting for Marianne, Elinor, their mother (Gemma Jones) and the way they endorsed or rebelled against conventions at crucial times where simpler things were complicatedly expressed. Indeed, everything that happened is due to something said, a promise or a misunderstanding. It's all in the way words are used, misused or distorted and that's one of the many delights in this lavish movie.\n",

            "Review 6: It's not easy to get seniors to do anything, even watch a movie and when you mention Jane Austen, they zone out. Yet each year when we do this film in class, about 80 percent end up loving it and that includes the guys. It's wonderful to watch them respond to the characters and get into a film that is so \"talky\" when they have been used to high action. To hear the girls call Willoughby a jerk and applaud Brandon at the end is great, but to listen to the boys comment on the behavior of the various characters is even better. How they respond to a society so filled with strict manners and codes of behavior also makes this film worthwhile and it generates much discussion about the importance of money in life; well, even Thompson in the commentary said the film is about money, who has it and who does not. I love showing this film to my students; after the groans when I start it on the first day, it's wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish. As one senior male said this year, \"I wouldn't have rented this or wanted to see it, but now that I have, I admit it was pretty good, so I'm glad you showed it.\" This is why they are classics, kiddies.\n",

            "Review 7: I found \"Sense and Sensibilty\" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since \"Finding Neverland\". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, all of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first. Kudos to her, she seems like a fine and intelligent woman. I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn't translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen's letters and put them into the movie.The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles. I enjoy period pieces thourelly, if you don't, you might want to skip it. But I would recommend this picture any day. It's very beautiful and a wonderful movie to watch. It has some of the finest British actors: Allen Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant. So give it a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.10/10\n",

            "Review 8: This is a remarkable film that does a very good job of depicting a rigid and quite hidebound society that often made India's caste system look reasonable and moderate by comparison.  One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the \"sense and sensibility\" of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores (probably by use of a crowbar) into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version, fine.  But it would be, at best, only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel, so why do an adaptation at all, then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, the long-suffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings. Were I Mr. Palmer, I'd have long since invested in earplugs or opened a vein.  Very fine film and most highly recommended.\n",

            "Review 9: This is one of the best of the recent Jane Austen films, from one of her weaker books. Emma Thompson has done a fine job of the script, not slavishly remaining faithful to the book but not abandoning it either.The cast are uniformally excellent. I especially liked Kate Winslet's Marianne and Alan Rickman's Brandon. Emma Thompson's performance is almost good enough to make you forget that she is far to old for the part. The supporting cast are all excellent.Ang Lee's direction shows the same skill that it did in the excellent Eat Drink Man Woman and the scenery and costumes are beautiful (perhaps too beautiful).This is more romantic and less comic than say Emma, and Thompson's script wisely stays away from the kind of set-piece gags seen in the recent film of Emma. All in all, this is excellent.\n",

            "Review 10: Jane Austen: This is her first and most human-centered work. More than cruel commentary on society this is -- Deft work.Emma Thompson: Her former husband is a decent actor, but his genius is in understanding how to cinematize Shakespeare -- no small challenge and no small talent. I'm thinking of how he would later put Kate's Ophelia in a padded cell! What Emma has done here is change a detached narrative text into discrete scenes anchored by dialogue. A cursory comparison with other Austen films (except the later 'Emma' which borrows much from this) will bear this out. Ang Lee: This is Lee's first English film, and already since he has established himself as a sensitive master of vision, like Ridley Scott and Steven Soderbergh. Lots of sensitive uses of the space, especially doorways. Many hard/soft contrasts (which he equates with sense and sensibility which is okay). He is a subtle visualist. Subsequent work is more confident than this, but its all softly refined, understated.Kate Winslet: All of the above are the results of first seriously public efforts and Kate's case is the same. At this writing seven years later, she is one of the anchors of multidimensional film acting. Kate makes this whole thing live. Austen's stance is one of self-aware storytelling: she is at once IN the story and OUTSIDE it, commenting on it. That's something that Kate already had mastered this early: she acts both the role and the girl acting the role.Honorable mention: Emilie Francoise, whose screen presence is rather remarkable.\n",

            "Review 11: I saw this movie in a cinema back in 1996 and since that June I have seen it about a dozen times. It is true, that being an ardent lover of the so-called Romantic (as if the 13th century couldn't be Romantic or 17th, but these things are academic nonsense) period I can enjoy even minor pieces of period cinema, however this is most probably the best film set in the early 19th century. Although it centers on the relationship of the two sisters and their respective romantic relationships, it also seems to be a salute to the period itself in its precise description of the English country society. It is truthful to Jane Austen's novel, but Emma Thompson's script is fine in its own right, with many omissions and additions to the novel. The acting is superb, Kate Winslet as the typical Romantic dreamer (sensibility) is breathtaking (try not to be moved when her character wanders in the rain to see the house of her beloved and when she whispers half-deranged: 'Willoughby, Willoughby, Willoughby.') is perfect as is Emma Thompson as the rational but equally tormented older sister(sense). Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semi-Byronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction, the music or the fantastic image composition. I would recommend everyone with some sort of emotional subtlety to see this film, for the story, the wit, the period and the imagery.\n",

            "Review 12: Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet) are the daughters of the second marriage of their father, in early nineteenth century England. When he dies, guess who gets most of the money? That's right, the son of the first marriage. These two beautiful young women are left without substantial dowries and must move to a small but snug cottage with their kind mother and their younger sister Margaret. Elinor is a sensible sort who makes good decisions while Marianne is a talented musician with a capricious nature. As luck would have it, a handsome, rich neighbor (Alan Rickman) takes a shine to Marianne, but as he is a bit older than she, she has no interest. Elinor makes the acquaintance of Edward (Hugh Grant), the brother of her insufferable sister in law, and likes what she sees but knows she has little chance to make a match with him. All of a sudden, Marianne is caught out in the rain with a twisted ankle, and the handsome man who rescues her, takes her heart, too. But, is he interested in her, as her prospects for money are dim? Will fate deal kindly with these two lovely, intelligent females? This extremely lovely movie, to begin, is based on Jane Austen's first novel and the story and dialogue are, therefore, beyond measure. Emma Thompson's screenplay is to be highly commended, as she has kept Austen intact and the story made to nicely fit the span of two hours. Next, the actors in this film could not be better, not only the four stars mentioned previously, but all of the secondary actors as well. Ang Lee's direction is stunning, as is the cinematography, the costumes, and the settings. The final scene, where coins are tossed in the air at a wedding, is one of the most beautiful ever recorded on film. If you care about what you watch on film, you will not miss this movie. Instead, you will sensibly rush off at the earliest possible moment and secure the video at the store or the library. After a viewing of this film, you will feel an immense satisfaction and happiness that comes only a few times at the cinema and, in fact, in life. Enjoy.\n",

            "Review 13: I love Jane Austen, and I love period dramas. This film, while a little too long, was perfect for me. I loved it when I first saw it a year ago, and I still love it now. Sense and Sensibility is a great book by Miss Austen, and this film does the book justice, in my personal opinion. The film looks gorgeous, the camera-work, the locations and the costumes. The script sparkled with wit, subtlety, romance and heartache, especially when Marianne goes out into the rain and gets herself ill. The music is lovely also. The performances were exceptional. Period-film veteran Emma Thompson is lovely here as Elinor Dashwood, and Kate Winslet matches her perfectly in a beautifully-blended portrayal of the tragic Marianne. As for the men, they were very good too. Hugh Grant was exceedingly charming as the male lead, and I have read many reviews criticising Alan Rickman's acting.(not on IMDb though) He may have been older than Miss Austen intended, he was very good also as Colonel Brandon, but not as good as the other three. His style of acting is very suave and charismatic, like Sean Connery and George Sanders. If you've seen him in Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves you'll know what I mean. All in all, a lovely film, maybe not the best period drama, but has plenty of elements that makes it truly memorable. 9/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 14: As with Pride and Prejudice, I have owned a copy of this film for about eight years, and I almost find it impossible to think that anyone could criticise it. A lot of people criticise the decision to cast Emma Thompson, then thirty-six, as nineteen year old Elinor, but I feel that the fact that she is clearly older than her character should be adds to Elinor's role as the logical, practical woman surrounded by a sister who wants to be a pirate, a fully-paid up romantic (Kate Winslet as Marianne) and a mother who doesn't appreciate the starkness of their newly-impoverished status quite as fully as she does. I always feel that - in this version at least - Elinor is forced to act older than she is to compensate for all this idealism. Another outstanding feature of the film is the quality of acting provided by the supporting cast. Imelda Staunton begins as an unbearably screechy woman and yet by the end of the film we see that she is more than capable of appreciating the gravity of a serious situation. Hugh Laurie as her husband Mr. Palmer is priceless (watch out for a scene where he is reading a copy of the newspaper The Porcupine). Greg Wise as Willoughby is incredibly convincing as the embodiment of Marianne's romantic hero who turns out to have a less than spotless reputation. Alan Rickman, who truly loves Marianne, is quite restrained enough and it soon becomes clear why he is so brooding.Personally I don't have a problem with the fact that it might not be totally faithful to eighteenth century life in terms of hygiene and cleanliness because - to me - that isn't what Jane Austen is about. It is supposed to be genteel and this film is. She didn't write to depict realism, she wrote to satirise and observe the society she lived in, and this is something the film never fails to do. If the girls remained as rich as they had in the beginning, I don't think we would have cared for them quite as much as we do. It is very much a handicap to their eligibility.On a final note, one really strong point is the costumes. They all seem to embody the period so well, and very accurately, too. Mrs. Jennings (being around sixty) wears clothes from an earlier period, and Mrs. Dashwood's clothes are not quite up to the minute, which adds another touch of realism to this outstanding film.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 15: For all the rest that can be said about this beautiful film, there is one reason why I particularly love it: During the whole movie you see Emma Thompson portraying Elinor successfully as a young woman who deeply loves, but who chooses to conceal her own feelings so she will not bring reproach on herself or her loved ones, or even on less deserving people. Emma Thompson succeeds in conveying all of this in looks, small hesitations, subtle body language and never are we in disbelief. It all seems real and right, and you can truly believe that people never saw her feelings although at the same time you can see that they are real and very deep. I compare it for an example with Amanda Root's portrayal of Anne Elliott in Persuasion; I really had a hard time believing people did not see through her sad puppy eyes and sighs and nervous grabbing chairs and all these unsubtle ways she would play out Anne's inner torment. Anyway, to come back to Emma Thompson and Elinor, I know some people thought that her reaction at the end of the movie, when she finally learns that Edward is not married and that he wants to ask for her hand, is not really lady like and maybe even exaggerated. I could not agree less. This is the reaction of someone who has been loving and feeling and hurting for a long time, holding it in so she would hurt people around her the least possible; and on the moment of learning that finally, happiness is within her reach, that finally all this has not been for nothing, she just bursts out in uncontrollable crying and sobbing. I just could not hold my own tears when I saw the movie the first time, and believe me, I am not one to cry over sappy love stories usually. I just identified so much with her self-sacrifice of every moment for so long, which suddenly turned into too much happiness to hold inside. Wow! That, in and of itself, is one reason to see and cherish this version of Sense and Sensibility; and then there is so much more but I'll leave it at that!\n",

P&P stays my favourite but S&S is very close.I can't agree with some of the comments that Hugh Grant wasn't proper for Edward Ferrars. Yes, maybe his age didn't match Emma Thompson's exactly but I think he acted wonderfully. His speech especially and stiff walk. I loved the scenes at the beginning where he made friends with Margaret Dashwood and played with her. It was so sweet.My favourite, however, was definitely Colonel Brandon! I think Alan Rickman was just perfect for that role. I've seen him only as professor Snape in the first Harry Potter film, so I can't compare very much but I would say he is a great actor. I love his voice (especially when he says \"What can I do? Give me some occupation, Miss Dashwood, or I shall run mad.), love his intonation and how he cares for Marianne so tenderly and patiently even though she turns her back on him. You can see the suffering in his eyes!I first read the book and didn't like it much but after seeing the film I'll reread it.

This was the movie that brought Kate Winslet her first Oscar nomination (and 1st Bafta win) and Emma Thompson her first award for best adapted screen play.

            "Review 20: Okay, non-fan might be too strong a description; I just find it hard to get into Jane Austen, though I do enjoy Pride and Prejudice. I caught this 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility on TCM last night, solely because of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman being present, and was shocked at how riveted I was from start to finish.Complete with handsome production values, fantastic direction from Ang Lee, lovely cinematography, and of course, the excellent performances, all make this a charming little romantic dramedy. It's also opened my eyes to just how good an actress Kate Winslet is, having had limited exposure to her until recently.Great film.\n",

            "Review 21: A totally engrossing story of the desperation of women to become subservient to men and take a master. Admittedly that was the expectation in those days, still is for far too many girls around the world but this kind of urgent determination to find a 'good' man to wait upon belongs in a museum along with some slave master statues. That aside, the acting, especially Emma Thompson is top notch, it's directed by a visionary and pioneer and it flows quite elegantly along with a poetic and humorous dialogue. Sadly, the only lessons to learn are those still being learnt some centuries later.\n",

            "Review 22: I am always interested in how a movie is received on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a film that won the top award at Berlin, but picked up a well deserved academy award for Emma Thompson--not for her acting skills but for her writing skills. Turning Jane Austen into delectable cinema is not an easy chore.The film is unusual. Chinese director Ang Lee (\"Crouching tiger, hidden dragon\") is not an obvious director that could have brought this literary work on screen--yet he deserves full credit in making the film as a top notch Britisher would have done. Even the executive producer is an American director of no mean repute--Sidney Pollack, who must have known that he was investing in a winner.I applaud Mr Lee for working with cinematographer Michael Coulter to make a film with so many shots that could have made so many picture-postcards. English landscapes have rarely looked so lovely. Details like ladies negotiating horse droppings make the film realistic or the silent appraisal by Willoughby's lady friend of Mariannae Dashwood (Kate Winslet) at the dance are executed with care and intelligence, not common in Chinese cinema. Mr Lee is truly international.Alan Rickman, for once, restrains his histrionics and is a pleasure to watch him interact with well chosen cast.What this film achieves is not merely introduce Jane Austen to new readers, but also argue that literary works can be modified intelligently on screen, without losing authenticity of the original, not just by the English but by people from far away lands. The Berlin Festival jury realized this very well.\n",

            "Review 23: This is a truly great movie. It is one that I can watch over and over, yet can never seem to get enough of! Kate Winslet is gorgeous, Emma Thomson is inspiring, and Hugh Grant shines in this unforgettable film. I have always loved a good movie; one i can sink into and fall in love with the characters. I feel that Sense and Sensibility presents all these things to the audience. There is love, heartbreak, humour and great music. (my applause to Kate Winslet for her unforgettable versions of \"Weep You No More Sad Fountains\" and \"The Dream\" ...so beautiful.) If you have not seen this movie, please go RIGHT now to rent it...or even ADD it to your video library! I must say it is well worth it! And if you have seen it. ....you know what i mean.Brava! Brava!

            "Review 24: Rich Mr. Dashwood (Tom Wilinson) dies, leaving his second wife and her three daughters poor by the rules of inheritance. The two eldest daughters are the titular opposites.I never really got into Jane Austen, and I do not believe I ever read \"Sense and Sensibility\". I had no idea it referred to two characters how they differed. Knowing that now, it makes me appreciate the title all that much more: it is like saying \"Reason and Emotion\" but with a much more alliterative sound. Heck, more than alliterative.How this got in the hands of Ang Lee is unknown to me, but I am glad it did. This is an adaptation that makes what could have been a dry, stuffy Victorian tale seem very much alive. And the excellent casting. Emma Thompson, who also wrote the script, is excellent, and the supporting cast: Kate Winslet, High Grant, and all the greats.\n",

            "Review 25: A wonderful enactment of Jane Austen's first novel from 1811, in which two sisters at the marrying age suffer from affairs of the heart. One has an inclination towards common sense and decorum (Emma Thompson), and the other, an emotional side, with great sensitivity to passion and romance (Kate Winslet). In addition to the heartbreak that comes from unrequited love and bad behavior from men, the film also makes clear the limited options women had in 19th century England, with paternalistic inheritance laws and limited employment options, something I liked about it.The production quality is very high here, with cinematographer Michael Coulter and director Ang Lee putting beautifully composed images on the screen, the costume and set designs truly taking us back in time, and an all-star cast delivering excellent performances. Winslet and Thompson each have several fantastic moments, and the supporting players are all rock solid as well, e.g. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, and on down the line. (Although Hugh Grant, much as I love him, always seems to be playing Hugh Grant, hair included here).A period drama is not one I would ordinarily leap to watching and this one certainly has its share of melodrama, but it's true to the period and the original work, so if you're looking for a great adaptation of classic literature, look no further (and oh, how I wish there were more such productions of the classics of Russian literature!). Just as importantly, though, the film drew me in from the beginning and kept up a good pace, managing to not feel overly stuffy or antiquated. Emma Thompson did a great job with the screenplay, and was worthy of the Oscar she won for it.\n",

            "Review 1: Despite most views of this movie, I thought it was just as good as (and in some aspects better than) the original.  Of course there was a lot  of recycled humor, but there was also a lot of original humor too.  I was a little bummed to find out that Courteney Cox wasn't returning in the second installment, but they did just fine without her.  I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see an Ace Ventura 3 someday.I thought the scene where Ace is trapped inside the animatronic rhino was the funniest scene in the movie, but the film is filled with other great scenes too.  I also loved the fact that he is a lover of all animals, except Bats.  I thought that was such a funny idea for the character.  I mean, what does that say about bats if a lover of all animals can't even stand them and finds them revolting.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh.  I just love the irony I guess.  Anyhow, there isn't much more I can say about this film other than if you liked \"Pet Detective\", you should see \"When Nature Calls\". \"Bumble-Bee Tuna\",-Chris\n",

            "Review 2: I didn't think the first movie was any great shakes.Sure, it had Carrey in it, running amok and mugging and mimicking and making every rude sound a kid would learn by eighth grade.  But the story just kept getting in the way.That's why \"When Nature Calls\", in my opinion, is much funnier.The story of securing a sacred bat is neither too intrusive nor annoying and leaves room for gags aplenty.  And Carrey....  Well, he enters a slapstick marathon and wins the gold in every event.  I swear the man is made of rubber.Some of the jokes are pretty gross (the spitting ritual, the \"guano\" references, etc.) but why should that come as any surprise?  Most comedies gear for that kind of humor anymore and, more or less sophisticated, reach the same common denominator: body fluids is funny, dude.Still, without the fluids and functions, there are still great scenes (Ace's entrance in the dining hall, the monks' reaction to his departure, his behavior at the slide show, his driving habits, his escape from a mechanical rhino) and plenty of opportunities to see Hollywood's most uninhibited comedian use every conceivable part of his body to make us laugh.I laughed.  His work is done.When this \"Nature\" calls, answer it.Nine stars.  And remember: do not pass go, do not collect $200.\n",

            "Review 3: Is it dumb? Well, it's definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that are undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it's also satirizing old stereotypes about \"Dark Africa.\" Is it immature and and gross and sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is.But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is funny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene where Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading up to a Buddhist temple? (\"It was RIGHT there!\") Or the slideshow in which Ace's hand appears to greedily devour a poacher's crotch? That's just hilarious!The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't settle for outlandish set-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its comedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented in-and-of-itself as humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra mile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (\"Stop hittin' yourself! Stop hittin yourself!\") And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through the jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and utters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck comefrom?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck's presence is a sublimely satirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just for cheap, lazy wackiness.This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him, pulls out all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He's milking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked the Sistine Chapel. He's inventing a manic persona so complete and fully realized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something mystical and poetic and truthful. And that's how it keeps from being annoying.This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie. I was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will achieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.\n",

There is a movie out there for everyone, something everyone NEEDs to laugh at and who can relate to. This movie is the opidemy of my humor and the extreme way it portrays the upper crust world of stuffy, snobby, self absorbed unrealistic people who think the world revolves around their view and opinions is classic and makes me laugh in a way that is honest for me.I read that some people were offended by it and want to get others to share their view. All I gotta say is, \"If you didn't like the first one, why did you go to see the second one? Just to complain?\" Do all of us \"Friends\" of Jim Carey a favor, if you don't like his humor, just go find some stuffy anal retentive \"fluff\" film, and write reviews on them that we will never read since those movies are for stuck-up self absorbed types.

            "Review 6: I have to say that the sequel is slightly better than the original (although most people would disagree).  I saw this movie in the theater with my friend and we saw it about 5 times after, and it still makes me laugh 4 years later.  There was one really small part on network TV (the movie aired before \"Storm of the Century\" on Feb. 14) after he pushes himself out of the rhino.  Made me laugh hysterically when he first walks through the Wachati town.  Great movie and Jim Carrey is still at his best.\n",

A couple of the dumbest scenes had me almost falling on the floor laughing...such as when Ace gets spears in his legs and the scene where he's inside a fake rhino! Hardly intellectual faire....but funny. A great film to watch with friends....especially the sort of friends whose favorite DVDs don't come from the Criterion Collection!\n",

            "Review 8: Well, then god help you. I've known people who are not big fans of Jim Carey's style of comedy and I can see their point. He's just outrageous and rarely witty. But this movie has a bit of everything: clever dialogues, beautiful locations, and of course Jim Carey at his very best.I find it much funnier than any of his other works. The Mask had too few of the 'mask' scenes, Pet Detective was just about OK, nothing great. This movie though is better because the story flows freely(unlike P.D) and it has a lot of Jim Carey (unlike The Mask). The scene at the monastery is actually brilliantly shot and to have such OTT comedy at what otherwise seems so mystical a location, I've never seen something like that. And lastly, yes it may seem a bit absurd, it's Ace's love for animals that comes out quite well. To have gone to a seclusion for losing a racoon(he was not paid to find anyways) is both hilarious and heart warming.The rhino scene alone would've made this one of my favorite comedies, but there's so much more on offer.8/10\n",

            "Review 9: Shikaka! Ace Ventura is one of my favorite movie characters of all time! This character catapulted Jim Carrey from small TV character actor from 'In Living Color', to A-list celebrity, when the film, 1994's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective became a surprise hit. The first movie was such a hit, it spawn a somewhat funny animated television series (1995 to 2000) and one really bad 2009 spin-off children movie, Ace Ventura, Jr.: Pet Detective. The best from all of these films, had to be the 1995 sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. This film has developed a large cult following since its release and I agree with them. This movie in my opinion, is probably the funniest Jim Carrey's movie in the 1990s. Yes, I said it! Jim Carrey reprises his role as the title character Ace Ventura, a detective who specializes in retrieval of tame and captive animals. This time, Ace Ventura is heading to Africa, to recover a sacred bat stolen from poachers, before two African tribes go to war because of it. Directed by Steve Oedekerk, the movie did a great job in location. I really thought, the movie was filmed in some type of Africa country. Actually, the film shot in various locations in and around Charleston, South Carolina, San Antonio, Texas and British Columbia, Canada. Who knew! The writing for this film is just amazing. Not only is the jokes, more hits than misses to the funny bone, but it's very clever with its gross out puns/sight gags, pop culture references, and movie parody humor of previous films like 1993's Cliffhanger. The crime solving mystery of the film is also pretty brilliant. You really get into the story, as Ace Ventura recover clue after clue. The best highlight of the film is Jim Carrey's acting. The way, he can move his body in a silly way for slapstick humor was astonishing. In his day, nobody could touch this guy for pure facial and voice comedy. You can tell that Carrey is having the time of his life just ad-libbing and winging it. Yes, he did overact, a bit here and became more like a cartoon than a person, but his overacting as Ace made it, very entertaining. This was Jim Carrey in his prime. He was and still is a mad genius at making people laughs, but lately hasn't found good material and tamed done since then. If there was any reason to watch this film, it's for his performance here. You'll find yourself, laughing more than once. I remember my whole family were crying, unable to breath with laughter the first time watching this. Spank you very much, Ace Ventura for making me laugh. The main theme song is pretty catchy by Robert Folk. The movie does a great job using establish songs like 'Secret Agent Man' & 'Lion Sleeps Tonight' to add to the humor. Indeed, the movie did come with alternative versions, when aired in syndication in International countries and on television. In order to receive a PG certificate, the UK release of the film features a number of cuts, equaling one minute and 35 seconds for the theatrical release, plus a further three seconds when re-classified for home video. This version is the worst, as it cut really funny scenes like Bumblebee tuna balls joke, and alternative version of the 'rhino scene'. Don't watch this version. Just find the US standard. Nature Calls does have considerably less offensive swearing, sexual jokes, and vulgarity than the previous film, but it doesn't really affects the quality of the film. Yes, there was Product Placement. An obvious ad of Subway is placed on a highway billboard early in When Nature Calls, but it was used as a gag about being in nature. The pacing is a bit off for a 90 minute film. Honestly, they could have cut like the whole first 15 minutes as it takes him forever to get to Africa and the story to start. None of the first part in the Himalayas and Tibet were that funny to begin with. The supporting cast was a bit missing. The female lead, the Princess (Sophie Okonedo) was barely in the film, and just there for somebody for Ace to bang with. It's a far cry from big female leads of Courtney Cox and Sean Young from the last movie. At less, this movie get a really good funny supporting character name Oda (Maynard Eziashi) that made scenes way funny. Ian McNeice as Fulton Greenwall & Bob Gunton as Burton Quinn & Simon Callow really did work, well as the straight man stock characters to Jim Carrey's outrageous cartoon character. Even fellow 'In Living Color' cast member, Tommy Davidson, got a few laughs in, as the Tiny Warrior. Overall: It's a movie that you find yourself, rewatching it time after time, because it's so funny. You'll find yourself repeating the funny phrases and wisecracks. Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is a must watch, must have, film to add to your comedy collection.\n",

            "Review 10: Without any shame I say : I love this film. Jim Carrey is a great comedian in my opinion and the Ace Ventura films remain his best and funniest achievements. I recommend this film to everyone who needs a good laugh when they're stressed or something. It's true : Ace makes you forget all your daily problems. I can't count the times I couldn't stop laughing. The story...let's say that's not very important but there's is a plot. To avoid a war between 2 African tribes, Ace has got to find back the sacred animal which is a big white bat. To do this, Ace gets stuck in a giant fake rhino, has to do a survival test made up by savages and infiltrate in the high society levels. I assure you this all turns into hilarious situations. I'm not saying it's better than part one, but it sure is more light-headed and there's much more variation. For the rest, all the elements that made Ace Ventura 1 so good, are present. And tons of it !!! Jim Carrey is a rather limited comedian. Either you love him or you can't stand him. If you love him, and his rubber face expressions, this film ( and the first of course ) are the best to check out. He'll probably never win an Oscar or end up in the \"best actor ever\"-list but I don't care. And I'm sure all other fans of this film don't care, neither\n",

            "Review 14: Despite being retired since a cliff top incident with a racoon, Ace comes out of retirement to help find a missing sacred bat that is the symbol of peace between two African tribes.  However he finds things are not all as it seems.The sequel to the first film was never going to be a fantastically inventive affair but rather more of the same, albeit not as fresh or different.  The plot is almost meaningless and certainly not important to enjoying the film. The comedy is everything and it almost manages to make for a good film. Opening with an inspired and hilarious Cliff Hanger spoof followed by a reference to William Shatner's episode of the Twilight Zone, the film fails to really keep it up and slips into relying wholeheartedly on Carrey's mugging.Mostly this is funny but it is less sophisticated than the first film (if it's possible to describe the first film as that!).  The jokes become more about the faces he pulls than about any invention in the dialogue or writing.  As such you'll like this or hate it based on how you like Carrey when he is manic.  I like him when I'm in the mood and laughed pretty regularly here.Carrey of course carries the film with ease but also has famous support like he did in the first film.  However they are not given as much to do and are of less value  Callow, Gunton and McNeice are not that missed when off-screen.  Of curiosity value are several British actors playing Nigerians  Akinnuoye-Agbaje is better known as the amazing actor from Oz on HBO and is given nothing to do here, meanwhile Okonedo is pretty and humorous for those of us who know her better for her gritty role in Clocking Off on BBC1.Overall anyone watching this should just be aware of what they are getting  it's a silly comedy that is totally reliant on Carrey's mugging to carry it. If you're not in the mood for that then avoid  but even if you are then you should be aware that it still might not be that good a film.\n",

            "Review 15: If there was to be just one pop-culture character with 'franchise' written all over it, it would be Ace Ventura. After the sleeper hit that was the original, Ace is shipped off to Africa, via Tibet, to find the missing sacred animal of the peaceful Wachati tribe. It is supposed to be a wedding gift to the savage Wachutu tribe, marking the congregation of their people.Ace is the best there is (the only there is) surely sending him to find the sacred bat (his most hated creature) is the 'right' thing to do. No matter how crazy he is. And how crazy indeed! This time around Jim Carrey goes completely wild as Ace. Any trace of an actual human that we saw before is surrendered to complete insanity. You can tell that Carrey is having the time of his life just ad-libbing and winging it. You can almost hear director Steve Oedekerk struggle to contain his laughter off-camera. There are even a few moments when Carrey himself almost cracks-up.I prefer this one to the first for a few reasons. First of all the production design is far superior and the faux-African jungle and tribal village colors really come alive. The widescreen photography gives the film a more expansive look than Tom Shadyac's original. Plus, it has a lot more animals, which I think is cool.Beside's the animated show, there's been no more of Ace Ventura since. But don't rule him out. Carrey may be sick of being regarded as the guy who made his anus talk, but I can only hope he'll do a third one day.\n",

            "Review 16: You either like Ace Ventura or you want to entrap him in a space capsule bound for the heart of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. If you are of the latter persuasion, don't read on. It will only prompt you to spend inordinate amounts of money on the space program to construct that black hole-bound capsule.Jim Carrey once again tears comedy a new black hole as pet detective Ace Ventura in ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS, the Hawaiian shirt-clad sequel to his breakout ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE.More muttonhead insanity for muttonheads. That doesn't mean this sequel isn't as bold, brash and bountifully braggadocio as its predecessor; a riotous laugh-a-minute wild kingdom zoo train (but see disclaimer above).Ace is called out of retirement by an explorer (a game Ian McNiece), to travel to Africa and locate a missing sacred white bat, which will avert war between two tribes. Along the way, he engages in a loogie-fest with the Wachati tribesmen, a test of manly skill with their opponents, the Wachootoo tribe (featuring Tommy Davidson as a maniacal little tribal warrior), is birthed naked by a robot rhinoceros, wrestles a crocodile, is forced into a Wolverine hairdo, deflowers a forbidden virgin tribesgirl, uncovers the whitey corporate plot (with Simon Callow as a contemptuous upper class Brit), and once again talks through his arse.It becomes obvious from this movie that Jim Carrey's inimitable performance in ACE VENTURA was no fluke and that his star rising was no accident. Seeing him in action, we realize that the White Boy from IN LIVING COLOR has become a dynamo force of nature that no vagaries of the industry could have stopped. Physical comedians Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Jerry Lewis were from an age long dead - the world was hungry for the next larger-than-life King of Comedy.Unlike mundane \"comedians\" like the Patton Oswalts and Ray Romanos (who rely on writing, direction, editing, soundtrack, to convey their stunted comedic stylings), Carrey is able to turn writing and storyline into a visual hurricane of ideas and kineticism, aware of every muscle in his body during every moment of screen time, ever driving to squeeze the last iota of juice from his performance. It is not that he is bombastic - of course he is, that's Ace - but that he can imbue that bombast with such creativity.Underneath it all, WHEN NATURE CALLS is a call to nature - the message of conservation spears home loud and clear. You Earth faddies should love that, right? No matter what you may think of Jim Carrey, he opened the way for a new strand of physical comedy, the likes of which Will Ferrell and Rob Schneider and Jason Biggs should be eternally grateful.So before you even speak of that black hole, deal with that black hole speaking....--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).\n",

            "Review 17: Though I consider the first \"Ace Ventura\" film to be perhaps my favorite comedy of all-time, \"When Nature Calls\" is nothing more than a shame to both the legacy of the first film and to Jim Carrey's career.Likely rushed to the theaters (only a year after part one) due to the success of the first movie, \"Ace 2\" never even comes close to capturing the pure hilarity of the first effort, and (on its own merit) isn't even that funny overall. Whereas in the first go-round Carrey was able to do his crazy facial reactions and physical comedy that made him a household name, in this film (because of the very poor quality of jokes/gags) he completely overreacts to every situation. I never thought I would say that Carrey could overreact to anything, but he actually does go WAY too far time after time after time.Though the first 10-20 minutes of \"When Nature Calls\" are moderately funny, from there the movie absolutely tanks. The first time I watched it, I actually fell asleep about 20 minutes in, as the jokes/Carrey were no longer holding my interest whatsoever.Thus, I would not wish this film on anyone. If you want more of Carrey's best performances, stay away from it at all costs, as it will leave you wondering how/why he would even sign off on the script.\n",

            "Review 18: (spoilers) Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is unmistakably a childish movie, but so is the first Ace Ventura, so what did you expect? The opening sequence involving a raccoon suspended from a wire high up in the mountains (in an amusing parody of Cliffhanger) is a little too cheesy even by Ventura standards at some points, but the movie as a whole is a very satisfying comedy. Ace commits himself to an Ashram after losing the raccoon, unable to bear the emotional turmoil of allowing the poor animal to fall to its death. When Fulton Greenwall shows up to ask for Ace's help in retrieving a sacred bat so that war between two African tribes can be prevented, Ace at first refuses the task, citing how sorely needed he is here at the Ashram. The monks' wild party after he agrees to take the case was a little too childish, but it was a hilarious scene when Ace rolls the slinky down the stairs of the Ashram (`Of course! Let's do all the things that YOU wanna do'), and it was even funnier when Greenwall was trying to explain the situation to Ace on the plane (`I'm sorry, what were you saying?').There are a lot of goofball antics that sink slightly below the level of Ace Ventura comedy, such as the dusting for fingerprints scene and Ace's `meditation' scene, but there is no shortage of laughs in the film. The hilarious scene at Ronald Kamp's party is also done in a slightly different version here, as Greenwall takes Ace to see Vincent Cadby at the consulate in Africa (`Funny, it didn't seem that painful when you were doing it to the horse'). Some of the jokes are recycled, such as Ace's breathless analysis of Cadby, but even these recycled jokes are not entirely without effect. In the movie's defense, at least the jokes weren't copied to the extent that they were copied in the sequel to Austin Powers, which was far inferior to the original.Jim Carrey delivered a style of acting in the Ace Ventura films that is fairly unique to them - he never really acted this crazy in any of his later films, probably because he became so much more well-known and this kind of acting was just too silly for the quality of an actor that he later proved himself to be. There was some of what could be called over-acting in Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, but the comedy is never compromised because of this. The Ace Ventura's are not the most classy comedies ever made, and they require the presence of at least some of your inner child in order to fully enjoy, but their comedic appeal is much higher than is common in movies like this. Watch them with an open mind, and you're sure to enjoy them.\n",

            "Review 19: A year before this sequel, we were introduced to Ace Ventura; a rude, wise cracking pet detective who has the reputation for being the ONLY pet detective. Guess what? He's back and still has every quality he had in the original. I know, it sounds like there's a catch here. Well there is not-at least with Jim Carrey's character. I did not like this movie as much as the original for one reason and one reason only. No it wasn't that Courtney Cox didn't reprise her role as Melissa Robinson. That I can deal with. My problem was that the story involved some characters that made Ace Ventura's character seem stupid. What made the original funny was that Ace Ventura was on top of his game. He knew what he was doing and how he was doing it. What also made it funny was that nobody ELSE knew what he was doing and although it seemed strange, Ventura got the job done. This occurred throughout the entire first film. And that's how it goes for most of this movie. The part of the movie that I think either did not need to be added or could have been modified was when Ace Ventura was among the African Tribes. What was so hard for me grasp was that in the first movie, they took a smart crazy detective and put him around a bunch of normal people that understood nothing of what he did. When Ventura is around the Tribe members, he is the dumb crazy detective. Why do I say this? Because Jim Carrey's character does not speak their language. It is this major flaw of why some of the laughs fail in this movie for me. For example, when Ventura starts to eat the food at the tribe's festival, he does not realize what he was eating until he is told what it really was. I thought Ventura was the smart one here? The whole point of the first film was so that the joke would be on everyone else; now the roles are switched? Why? Does the laugh really need to be on our comedic hero? It was at that point I started to wonder whether Ace really knew what he was doing.Of course these kinds of instances did not happen all the time. There were many parts where Ventura was surrounded by upper class people who thought they were better than he was and just like the first film he proved them wrong with a snotty remark and an obscene gesture. That's the old Ace I know! That is what made Ace Ventura such a character. Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is almost a perfect sequel. It still has good laughs but it is dumbed down by its mediocre screenplay. It is because of this that Ace Ventura does not seem always on top of everyone else like he was in the first film.\n",

            "Review 20: ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS, in my opinion, is a pure gut-buster. I laughed really hard when Ace (Jim Carrey) sang \"The Slinky Song,\" imitated jungle animals, and mocked the Monopoly guy (Michael Reid MacKay). As a matter of fact, I laughed at just about every funny thing he did. In addition, I have a lot of favorite parts of this movie, especially when Ace picked up the skunk and said, \"Say hello to my stinky friend.\" Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, \"If you're going to see this movie, prepare to laugh until it hurts!\" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this gut-busting comedy to those of you who are Jim Carrey fans or like gut-busting laughs.\n",

            "Review 22: From beginning to end, this is not only a comedic masterpiece, but a dramatic one as well. A very serious (and global) story is told with the protagonist being one very off-beat, colorful and animal-friendly \"detective\". Ace goes to the ends of the Earth, confronting his deepest fear (that of bats), and foresaking the relative security of the \"ashram\" to fulfill himself, retrieve lost animals.., and collect the $10,000.\"There's....something!! Something, on the wing!!\" Ace brings a splash of synthetic color and eccentric humor to the traditionally dressed and mannered African tribe who are his host. Nevertheless, they become endeared to him and accept him.., at least temporarily. Every moment is hilarious, even when he is caught by a neighboring, hostile tribe and sentenced to the Wachutu trials of death. The ending is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie, and totally unexpected: Ace manages to find the sacred bat and save a princess from a forced marriage, as well. (The results of his efforts are unanticipated, though.) There is nothing like this movie, and it is a gem to be treasured.\n",

            "Review 23: The beginning of the film which presents a parody of the film \"Cliffhanger\" (1993) is the sole real acceptable idea of making in this flick. What's next? Well, simply, the rest remains at the zero level (and surely less) of what American comedy can deliver. Everything is out of control, including the script. All right, we can distinguish a story that could have hold water. But it is relegated to a position of secondary importance to give way to a series of cock-and-bull scenes where stupidity prevails. They are also scattered by ponderous racist jokes about the Africans and murdered by Jim Carrey's tomfooleries. He looks more like a retarded teenager than an animal detective.How would you define \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\" to someone who doesn't know the film at all? Lobotomized cinema at its best! And by the way, congratulations Mr Carrey: you have made you finest rubbishy film.\n",

However, Some sequels should have not been conceived.Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is not funny. This movie is more than just stupid, it's has a lower I.Q. than Forrest Gump. This movie does not rely on good comedy, it relies on complete and utter stupid s**t.I was shocked on how much this sucked. The first movie had good witty comedy with a slab of clever to boot. The clever and wit of the first is not here. The plot is meaningless, the acting is too desperate and the comedy fails on so many levels. There are a few funny parts, but the rest is stupid humor, garbage humor, rinse and repeat. The main problem: somebody did not burn the script.The Last Word: If you like stupid, and I mean unintelligent crap, than this is for you. The comedy gets tired and forced. At least Carrey got to pay the rent with the paycheck, so it's not a total loss.\n",

            "Review 1: Barry Sonnenfeld was and maybe wasn't the right choice to make Get Shorty. He's a great visualist, and his films (Adams Family, Men in Black) are also very funny, but it's hard to say whether or not another director might've taken Elmore Leonard's sly comic novel more seriously or with less depth. As it is, however, Get Shorty is a cool little treat that doesn't over-stay its welcome, and provides its cast a plethora of witty dialog.  John Travolta brings on some sharp attitude, knowing the angles and wanting, as his character Chili Palmer, to get into Hollywood and out of loan sharking. Gene Hackman's funny as a fledgling producer with his first, true big hit in his lap.  And supporting parts from Delroy Lindo, Renne Russo, Danny De Vito (as 'Hollywood' as you'll ever see him), and James Gandolfini, are all very worthy.  It's a worthwhile watch, with a dead-on score from John Lurie.  But I would reccomend Out of Sight or Jackie Brown to Leonard fans looking for a great adaptation.  It's a very good Hollywood picture (reflective of what it's about), though it's not a masterpiece.  A-\n",

            "Review 2: Spoilers herein.I do not expect Hollywood to ever bowl me over; I depend on other film communities for that. The Hollywood machine is so preoccupied with avoiding risk via lowbrow entertainment that we usually end up without intelligence or cleverness in our lives with them. But there are a few figures connected to that machine that I can rely on. DePalma for an intelligent eye; Ridley Scott for managing time; Soderbergh for framing and so on. But the influence of these folks rarely extends to the project as a whole.That's not the case with Danny DeVito. Forget his acting; as a director or producer you can always count on his intellect and sometimes we also get a coherent film out of the deal. In other words, we get something that conforms to the Hollywood principles (fun, exploits actors in the best way, solid production values) and at the same time has enough intellectual depth to allow some sun to shine in through cosmic windows.This film is one of those. It is not on my `must see' list, but it is one of the best Hollywood productions of the last decade.The setup is like `The Player,' a film about the writing of itself, about how life copies film and vice versa. Along the way, it subverts gangster pictures in a slightly different way than `Pulp Fiction' of the previous year - also produced (and significantly influenced) by DeVito. I really appreciate `folding' like this, and make a study of them. I already have a database of nearly a thousand examples of folding. It is a fascinating phenomenon, but rarely is it sheer fun.This one is folded and fun.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.\n",

            "Review 3: John Travolta followed up his \"Pulp Fiction\" comeback with \"Get Shorty\", in which he plays Miami hit-man Chili Palmer. Moving to Hollywood to collect a debt, he finds that show biz isn't much different from the mafia, and he decides to get involved. But of course, once there's anything mafia-related involved, things start to get ugly. Not that they weren't already seedy.This movie has its strengths mainly in the script, but also in the strong performances from Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. I guess that any time that someone gets a chance to show Hollywood's unseemly side, they take it. Of course, there's plenty of reasons to do so. The sequel, \"Be Cool\", wasn't quite as good, but still worth seeing.\n",

            "Review 4: Elmore Leonard's books must be loved by film screen adapters. His characters translate very well from the written page to the moving picture. \"Get Shorty\" is one of Mr. Leonard's best stories and it gets a very good treatment in the hands of Barry Sonnenfeld, its director, with the help of Scott Frank, who adapted it for the screen.The casting of the movie was it's greatest asset. John Travolta is so cool as Chilli, the mafioso who loves movies! In his scenes with Gene Hackman, he demonstrates what a good actor he is. On the surface, he appears to do nothing; he works with an economy that is very hard to imitate. Granted, after Mr. Travolta's amazing appearance in Pulp Fiction, this was a confirmation and validation of his talent.It was surprising, since I didn't remember his appearance on the movie, to watch actor James Gandolfini, prior to his recent fame. He plays a stuntman turned wise guy. Mr. Gandolfini must have gone through a great dental cosmetic transformation, unless he was made up to look very ugly, as Bear, in the film. I have greatly admired his work before his TV series, as a fine character actor, which he demonstrates here the potential he had and was not discovered until much later.Delroy Lindo is also excellent as one of the bad guys in the film. This actor, who is as great in films as in the theater, deserves much better. He is a man that always gives an honest performance. Not being a Danny DeVito fan, I must confess that he was very restrained here. He can do very good work with the right director behind him, as he shows playing the egotistical actor, Martin Weir.Also excellent, Dennis Farina. It's unfortunate he doesn't get better choices because he is always very effective in whatever he plays. In this film, he is hysterical as Ray \"Bones\" Barboni. Rene Russo, as the bit player with a heart of gold, is good. What can be said of Gene Hackman that hasn't already been said? His Harry Zimm is so accurate that we believe he is this sleazy Hollywood producer. Mr. Hackman is a consummate performer who keeps getting better all the time.\n",

            "Review 5: Smart, funny mobster comedy/satire based on the novel by Elmore Leonard. Travolta is well-cast in one of his very best roles as a slick, full-time Miami loan shark/enforcer (and part-time movie buff) who travels to Los Angeles to cash in a loan, but instead ends up teaming with B-movie writer/producer Hackman to fulfill his dream of being connected to the movie business. Before he can however, he must deal with bumbling mobsters, white-collar criminals, and the anxiety of trying to find the right leading man. Crackling, hilarious dialogue, well-drawn characters, and clever insight into Hollywood moviemaking run rampant in this snappy little comedy. Maybe not for all tastes, but well-made and a definite must for Travolta fans. ***\n",

            "Review 6: I am not sure whether I liked the movie or just John Travolta and his character Chili Palmer. I had a lot of fun watching 'Get Shorty', based on the novel by Elmore Leonard, so it doesn't really matter. The movie is about a mobster from Miami, Chili Palmer, who ends up in Los Angeles. After meeting a movie producer named Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) he gets interested in the movie business. This is the main story, but this movie is based on an Elmore Leonard story so there are a lot of sub-plots with lots of interesting characters, all with great dialogue.Besides Chili Palmer and Harry Zimm we meet Karen Flores (Rene Russo), an actress known for her screaming, Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) who is the hot actor of the moment, Ray Bones (Dennis Farina) who wants to collect some money that Chili has, Bo Catlett (Delroy Lindo) who wants money fro Harry Zimm, Bear (James Gandolfini) who was a stuntman but now is Bo's bodyguard, Leo Devoe (David Paymer) who stole the money that brought Chili to Los Angeles and Doris (Bette Midler). All characters are colorful, have great dialogue and an interesting part in the story, but all those great things are there together with Chili. For every nice moment Travolta is present.The actors play their characters very well. Again, Travolta is great and owns the movie, but especially Farina and Hackman do a great job as well. The movie is well directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (from 'The Addams Family'), knowing how to avoid boring moments. The story with its dialogue would be enough to make a nice movie out of it. Fortunately we have the actors and direction to make it even better and definitely more entertaining.\n",

            "Review 7: One of the great mysteries of all time, right up there with Area 51 and the Da Vinci Code, is why the film industry, now into its second century and -- as you read this -- consuming on a relative basis more bandwidth than any other form of media, cannot produce consistently decent product? Now don't misunderstand. This is not to say that most movies are inherently bad, for that is not true either. However one of the dirty little secrets of the industry is that the \"breakout\" ratio is around 20:1. That is, for every 19 forgettable products that are churned out -- products that keep the cable and streaming media pipelines full, and keep food on the table for all the electricians, caterers, and Best Boys -- about one actually is memorable enough to attract a permanent audience or become near-iconic. Not a very efficient ratio! The late Marshall McLuhan tried in his lifetime to develop the notion of \"media ecology,\" essentially the premise that the cultural output of a society was no less important than any other industry output, and therefore an effort should be made NOT TO WASTE THE RESOURCES or (simply put) produce junk. Like the infamous joke about about the \"Nietzsche graffiti\" (first line: \"God is dead - Nietzsche.\" Second line: \"Nietzsche is dead. God\") that attempt did not turn out so well. McLuhan is gone, and the ratio has arguably gotten worse, because there are now many more pipelines to fill. Which brings us, belatedly, to GET SHORTY, not only a great film (one of Travolta's best performances, so effortless you wonder if he phoned it in, and Pixar just added a body) but one of Hollywood's most \"inside\" scripts ever. (Comedians have \"inside jokes.\" Hollywood has \"inside scripts.\") The premise here is that the making of a movie has little to do with the movie, and everything to do with egos and business capabilities of the people making it. The idea that a professional mobster could stumble into Hollywood and suddenly realize that making a film is no different than planning a hit, or a robbery, is sheer brilliance. And very close to home. In the history of the medium, it is one of the only movies to deal with the delicate (and unpopular) issue of ... why so many bad films have to be made, simply to produce one good one...?\n",

            "Review 8: Anything involving something by Elmore Leonard is generally very good, in and of itself. But when coupled with performances like those of John Travolta and Gene Hackman in this picture, the result is a superb piece of entertainment.Danny De Vito, Dennis Farina and Rene Russo all deliver outstanding performances - but all pretty much convey the types of personas, on-screen, which you'd expect from seeing their other work.However, of all actors today - young or older, new or veteran -- there are no two who are more convincing, in everything they do, than Travolta and Hackman. Serious or funny, crafty or clueless, hero or villain - - each has been completely convincing in every role, and seeing them together, one would like to see them teamed again.In this movie, both are funny, and both have their roles \"nailed:\" Travolta as the confident tough guy, completely in control; and Hackman as the \"B\" flick producer, operating on the fringe of the Hollywood scene and life in general.As much as I liked this movie, I first saw it in a St. Louis hotel suite, where we selected it from the PPV menu. I was \"fried\" from a day-long business meeting, and fell asleep early into it. The next day, my wife insisted that I catch it (she's one of those people who has perhaps only wanted to watch one or two other movies a second time, ever), and I was glad she did. It's an outstanding film, and one which entertains thoroughly from the outset to conclusion, with not a single lapse between.\n",

            "Review 9: After hearing, I can see instantly why this is the author, Elmore Leonard's favorite movie adaptation from his writing. First of all John Travolta was a solid-standard, as Chili. If you're a Travolta fan, this is an instant classic performance for him!! He personifies East coast attitude and 'M.O'. His breeze onto the scene and in control persona are a part of this movie that would have collapsed it, had it not been an ingredient in this mix of action, sarcasm and loan-sharking gone amok. Chili is superior. Gene Hackman, is an attempted to be cool, b-movie director, who hasn't had a hit in years, and you can feel it. Gene's man Harry is so played-right it's embarrassing. I know people that are like that. I was laughing till it hurt, from the familiar pain, of the ones who reminded me of the great Harry Zimm. Hackman is astounding.Before there was the Sopranos there was {James Gandolfini as} 'Bear' Bo's handy-man, his fix-it guy all around. Bear reminds me (sort of) one of my cousins. Ha, take that home with ya in a doggy bag!Danny Devito, is a great self-conscious (and to others feelings) selfish and unconscious, totally absorbed actor, who is about the way it is with many of the actor types, who let it go too far. Danny is the man!Rene Russo is the lovely, Karen Flores of course and she is as pretty in pictures as in 'Real' life. I got to meet her in 1992, and got a really great hug from her, she's very thoughtful and talented, with much more talent to follow after this great film.The way the story was set up and progressed with, makes me love this and puts it in a special place in my entertainment library. This is a fun 'You gotta see it and experience the mood and all the other emotions that follow' type of movie madness that makes watching some movies, very worthwhile. This is a high rater!!!

            "Review 10: When his boss has a heart attack, mob hard man Chili Palmer finds himself working indirectly for Ray Barboni. Barboni's instance on picking through his books and finds the case of a dry-cleaner who owes money but is dead. With pressure to cover the debt himself, Chili sets out to find the man who he knows isn't really dead  his search takes him to LA where he follows up another debt in the form of Harry Zimm. Zimm is a producer of trashy movies and Chili sees him as his way into the movie business and out of loan sharking  businesses that he realises are actually not that different.With the release (and drubbing) of the sequel, I decided to take the chance to watch the original film again and review it because I hadn't seen it since it first came out a decade ago. The story is potentially quite messy as it has quite a few threads with different characters coming and going quite quickly and it is to its credit that it manages to hold it all together and bring it off satisfyingly well. It doesn't have a great deal of depth of course but it only aims to be slick and it manages to do this pretty well considering. The script has plenty of injokes to match the slick dialogue and narrative and the story does move along in a manner that is enjoyable on several levels. I think claims that it is \"hilarious\" is maybe taking it a bit too far because it isn't really laugh out loud funny more than once or twice but it is entertaining in a stylish and slick way that makes it quite fun to watch.The cast really help and the majority of them give enjoyable performances even if the aforementioned depth isn't there for them to do a great deal with. Travolta enjoys a funnier version of the role that gave him his mid-nineties comeback with Pulp Fiction and he handles himself well  as slick as he is sleek and with a really cool presence that is important since the character is nothing more than cool presence. De Vito does really well sending up movie stars (specifically, if we are to believe all we read, Dustin Hoffman) but Russo seems to be an addition with nothing specific to do despite her still being enjoyable. Farina can do mobsters in his sleep so at least here he gets to enjoy himself at the same time; Lindo is a good match for Travolta and is a good bit of casting with good support from Gandolfini. In joke cameos are \"take it or leave it\" so they are not critical to the film but Keitel, Baldwin and Marshall stand out as being in there.Overall this is not a film that is hilarious or one that has great character development. Rather what it is is a slick story told with style and swagger  much like Chili himself. The plot threads are helped by not ever having a lot of detail behind them to be picked up but they are still potentially messy and the film does well to bring them all together in a pleasing and knowing fashion. The starry cast is good value and all in all the film is entertaining; which was all I really wanted from it in the first place.\n",

            "Review 11: I saw this movie in 1995 when first released, but never got around to thinking about a review until I saw it again a few weeks back on late night TV. I'd forgotten just how good it is...From a novel by Elmore Leonard, this story is arguably the best satire about the Hollywood dream factory yet done, for two reasons: it savagely exposes and lampoons the behaviors of actors, writers, producers and directors and it implicitly compares that business with the business of small time hoodlums and loan sharks. So many times during this story does Chili Palmer (John Travolta) announce, in a bemused fashion: \"I can't believe how youse guys do business out here...\" Chili, as we learn very early, is a loan shark from Miami who is ordered by Bones (Dennis Farina), his new boss, to recover a $15,000 debt from Leo (David Paymer), a loser with a garrulous wife, Fay (Linda Hart) who's helped Leo fake his own death on a plane crash and collect $300,000 as a settlement from the airline. Fay, of course, can't keep her mouth shut and tells Chili that Leo scammed the money and was now living it up in Vegas. Chili, in Vegas, finds out that Leo has gone to LA. But Chili also makes a score: a Vegas casino owner asks him to lean on an LA movie producer, Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman) for $150,000 still owing.So, off to La-La Land goes Chili, and that's where the fun really starts...The plot then changes direction, almost completely: Chili, after recovering most of the $300,000 from Leo (and letting him off lightly), gets involved with Harry in two ways  first, convinces him to take on Chili's own idea for a movie production and second, fend off two \"investors\" (who just happened to be drug pushers also) who want their money back from Harry who  you guessed it  is late in getting some other movie off the ground, and has spent all their money.However, those two pushy investors, Bo Catlett and Ronnie Wingate (Delroy Lindo and John Gries), have another problem: the $500,000 drug money that they can't retrieve from a locker box at LAX and which Chili sees as an opportunity to make more profit. That idea, however, is blown away when Bones  who would like nothing better than to see Chili dead -- arrives from Miami looking to muscle in on Chili's business in LA.How all that threads together into a gloriously comedic and ironic slice of Hollywood life and death is a testament to Leonard's brilliant story, a great screenplay and cinematography and tight editing  not to mention the almost flawless acting by actors who are continually taking the mickey out of the whole business, right up to the final scene.There's no doubt that this is Travolta's comeback movie. The guy just oozes dangerous cool and --- ooops  chilling competence as he maneuvers between the high and low life of a strange town, with some very strange people and even stranger business practices. But, kudos also go to Dennis Farina, Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito as the klutzes they portray; and Renee Russo is suitably decorous as Chili's love interest. Watch out for cameos from Bette Midler, Harvey Keitel and other Hollywood luminaries.And, here's the supreme self-referential irony: there really is a real Chili Palmer in the movie; he's one of the actors who has a bit part as one of Bones' buddies! What a gag...Finally, note the title: Get Shorty. That's Elmore Leonard's delicious swipe at the whole gangster genre. Remember Get Carter (1971)...? Ho-ho-HO-ho-ho! Highly recommended.\n",

            "Review 12: This film is based on the Elmore Leonard book of the same name. This is a hilarious satire of Hollywood. Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is a loan shark from Miami tracking down a deadbeat who has run off. Palmer's travels take him to Hollywood, where he meets Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman). Zimm is a producer of major motion pictures (read B horror flicks). His lover is Karen (Rene Russo). His meetings give Palmer the \"movie bug.\"Already a huge movie fan, Palmer decides to produce \"Mr. Lovejoy\" a script that Zimm proclaims will be hs \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" The plot centers around efforts to raise the necessary money and land Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) in the lead role. Fortunately Weir is Karen's es-husband. And Palmer has access to $300,000 generated from Las Vegas winnings of the missing deadbeat, Leo. As a further complication there is a drug dealer (Delroy Lindo) who has invested in one of Zimm's pictures. But he has gotten in trouble with his supplier for $500,000 and a missing nephew.DeVito does a wonderful job playing the self-involved, pretentious Weir. There are wonderful comments about screen writers. Spelling is optional, not necessary. The role of a screenwriter is just to put the commas in where they belong. Travolta is delightful as a \"nice guy\" wiseguy. In fact, the entire cast is just great.The plot lines never overwhelm the film, and they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. (Note: Thanks to Pulp Fiction, studios are willing now to use non-linear plot lines on occasion.). The ending is terrific (watch for the cameo by Harvey Keitel). I saw this in the theatre and have seen it several times on video. This one is definitely a keeper.\n",

It's an unusual original story about tough gangster put in an unnatural environment, who thinks that are making movies is the same as any other criminal activity.The movie is cleverly written with many different characters, that all follow one and the same plot line. All characters have different motivations but they are all cleverly connected to each other. The many characters often mix and meet each other in the events, which also causes all of their motivations to mix. The movie is really cleverly written and executed. It perhaps sounds like a complicated and hard movie to follow but it really is a light, great written and pleasant one to watch.The movie also works because of the many fine characters and of course the actors that portray them. Basically every character in the movie is deliciously stereotypical, from the Hollywood-producer to the stunt guy and from the successful acclaimed Hollywood actor to the mobster boss. The movie is well cast with actors that are obviously not cast because of their comical talents but purely because of their acting skills. The cast is one to kill for. John Travolta of course knows how to play a cool and likable gangster. Gene Hackman also plays one of his most fun roles as low-budget Hollywood producer, who thinks that he is going to make it big time. Danny DeVito is great as an Hollywood-actor and Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, Miguel Sandoval provide the good gangster parts of the movie. David Paymer also does what he can do best; playing a guy with a hat. The movie is filled with many more well known actors in small roles, such as Bette Midler and James Gandolfini and even small cameo appearances such as Harvey Keitel makes.Also mainly due to the movie its professional cast, this is not an hilarious type of movie but more the sort of movie that has a constant pleasant and light atmosphere that will surely put a smile on your face. The comedy is more of the subtle kind, that everybody should be able to appreciate. Nothing in the movie ever feels forced, no matter how crazy and mixed up the movie and its situations ever get.As far as the '90's go; this movie is about as cool as they could get. This movie was the definition of cool in the '90's, at the time of its release. Of course times have changed now but the movie still has an overall cool atmosphere and pleasant way of storytelling. It's a light fun movie to watch and re-watch over and over again.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\n",

            "Review 14: \"Get Shorty\" is a celebration of that usual Barry Sonnenfeld style of film making. Great characters, done by a great cast including John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo and.. Well the list just goes on and on. A perfect mix-up of that so called \"character-comedy\", a movie progressing and dependant on the characters, making it hilarious comedy chaos.The best thing about this film is obviously the whole cast, John Travolta as the smooth bad ass Chili Palmer, Gene Hackman as the hectic Harry Zimm. A bit unusual role from Hackman, which also makes the character so hilariously surreal. Rene Russo as \"the girl\" Karen Flores, Danny DeVito as the movie star Martin Weir with a huge ego, Dennis Farina as the loud mouth usual himself Ray 'Bones' Barboni. Delroy Lindo as the tough Bo Catlett and James Gandolfini as Bo's bodyguard, failed stuntman Bear. Everyone just simply click together, which makes the movie even better than it actually is. It's just all about the characters. Chili Palmer must be one of the coolest characters ever seen on the big screen.Like mentioned before, Barry Sonnenfeld is the director of the movie and I honestly can't imagine anyone else directing a movie with a screenplay like this except Steven Soderbergh, the director of for example both \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"Ocean's Twelve\". I think that Sonnenfeld's and Soderbergh's styles connect together, they are very similar. And if they'd do a British version of the movie, the director would be Guy Ritchie without a doubt. If you recognised both Soderbergh and Ritchie, then you know the style I'm talking about and if you like both of their movies you should see \"Get Shorty\". The other thing similar between these three directors besides the directing is the music used in their films. It's that usual horns and trumpets, giving that funky and exciting feeling for the film. It just fits for movies like these, creating that what is needed for the style. It also connects with the cinematography as well; Sudden movements of the angles, sudden stops, shots really close of the faces in these specific angles and when you add the music to that it's voilá.\"Get Shorty\" is all in all a great comedy with a plot that doesn't go over the silliness level. Sometimes movies like these go over that level, which usually make them funnier but also makes the whole story so unbelievable that it just isn't enjoyable as a movie anymore. Well the movie itself isn't THAT serious, it's a comedy after all, but it's definitely some quality entertainment. It includes a nice storyline, great characters and directing that just doesn't let you down. I recommend this movie to everyone once again. It's not amazing or phenomenal, it's a nice piece of entertainment, keeping you glued to your sofa throughout. What more can you ask for a boring Friday evening?\n",

            "Review 15: ... as a debt collector for the mob who is based out of Miami. John Travolta is borrowing a lot from his part in \"Pulp Fiction\" here as far as attitude and presence. At least the cool mob guy part. But he's completely likeable and he has a love and encyclopedic knowledge of film comparable to the late Robert Osborne. And he gets rough when he has to, usually with another mobster from a different crew who is always trying to push him around (Dennis Farina as Ray Barboni). Chili gets the best of him without breaking his stride or his countenance. He'll graze the top of a guy's head with a bullet just on the chance he is up to no good when he enters his office without knocking, yet open the car door for a woman because he is a gentleman - a truly fascinating character.Twists of fate have him in LA collecting a debt from a schlock horror director, Harry Zim (Gene Hackman) who also owes money to some other mobsters, who owe money to still other mobsters. It gets complicated, and I won't spoil it for you, but it is easy to follow if you pay attention, and Travolta is a delight to watch as a shylock who really just wants to make movies and uses his inherent charm and street smarts to wheedle his way into producing movies and get the girl.With Danny De Vito in a supporting role as big star Martin Weir (the \"shorty\" in the film title ), Rene Russo as a B horror actress with brains who actually wants to produce, and James Gandolfini as a two-bit hoodlum four years before The Sopranos.It looks like one of those films everybody had a good time making, and you know you are watching a satire when somebody has a line saying someone is \"Dead as disco\" when talking to Travolta. Highly recommended as a love letter to and a satire of Hollywood.\n",

Funny and entertaining adaptation of Elmore Leonard's crime novel about Chili Palmer (Travolta, perfectly charming) a loan shark from Miami who heads out to LA after a pay cheat and winds up in Hollywood teaming up with horror schlock producer Hackman and B-film screamer Russo pitching a story and avoiding some not-so-pleasant criminal types along the way.  Great satire and excellently keen in keeping Leonard's dialogue intact with some dead-on spoofing of Tinsel Town in particular De Vito as a Method actor run amok.  Look for director Barry Sonnenfeld as a parking valet and also the real Chili Palmer as one of Farina's dinner companions at the film's pre-credit sequence prior to Travolta punching out Farina.\n",

            "Review 17: A thoroughly enjoyable comedy/thriller about a connected loan collector, John Travolta as Chili Palmer, who is sent by his boss, Dennis Farina, from Miami to Los Angeles to collect $300K from a drug dealer who has decided to keep the payment for himself by hiding it in a locker at Los Angeles International Airport. What Farina doesn't realize is that Travolta is a stone movie freak and is converted by the seductive movie-making atmosphere of L.A. from a semi-hit man into a would-be producer. The money that Travolta intends to invest may still be sitting in that gym bag in LAX, surrounded by ill-disguised DEA agents who are waiting for someone to try to get it, but everyone knows the money exists and they treat it as if it's not just real, which it is, but readily available, which it's not.It reminds me of the fiscal situation on Yap, an island in Micronesia. The Yapese have a kind of \"money\" too. Huge stones, laboriously carved out of a mountain on a distant island and carefully shaped, then shipped hundreds of miles to Yap. In one case, a monstrously heavy stone fell from the canoe offshore and fell to the bottom of the ocean. But it was still counted as being in circulation because, after all, all the Yapese had seen it and knew it was there.The story in this movie is more complicated and involves a dozen or more characters, all of whom would love to get their hands on that money. Some want to use it to make a lousy movie -- with Travolta cheer leading this contingent -- and others want it because they figure it belongs to them. Some die but no one mourns them. The deaths may be richly comic.What makes it possible for us to enjoy this story of bullying, threats, violence, greed, lust, and murder is its cheerful acceptance of the philosophical propositions of moral nihilism.When Travolta is confronted by a muscle man, James Gandolfini, he kicks him in the shin and sucker punches him without adumbrating the act. When Gandolfini hits the ground, groaning in pain, we can afford to laugh at it because the values behind the movie have given us permission to do it. Travolta squats next to the supine figure and begins chatting with him about the movies in which he's been a stunt man. Sixty movies. Oh, yeah? asks Chili, which ones? And Gandolfini modestly begins mentioning some, dismissing their quality over Travolta's objections. The two chat as if the assault had never taken place.Nothing is good or bad but thinking makes it so, said Hamlet. We're on the side of Travolta, of course, because he's the unpretentious hero captivated by movies, just like the rest of us, but a guy who can handle himself too. And he convinces us, just as he convinces the others, that an entertaining movie can be made from this lousy script he's come into possession of. He cares nothing about other people, just movies. But at least he cares for movies. That's \"good\" in a film like this. It's constructive and Travolta's motive is passion. The \"bad\" guys just simply want the money because it's coming to them, and in some cases they're right. The Latino gang has taken a risk by shipping the drugs into the USA. They have a legitimate claim to it because, as one of the four factors of production, the \"entrepreneurs\", they've earned it. They may be right but they're still \"bad\" in this context.The \"friendships\" and affairs mirror the moral nihilism of the other narrative strands. Nobody's in love. Nobody really cares deeply about anybody else. Allegiances shift like the wind. Betrayals are commonplace. And it's all so boldly stated that it comes out amusing.The dialog is pretty sharp and the characters well observed. The egocentricity of celebrities and the rich and powerful is used for laughs. Tiny Danny DeVito sits down at an al fresco café and orders the waitress to bring an omelet, but it has to be made with only egg whites, and the shallots have to be only slightly browned -- not too much -- and then he leaves before it arrives. When an acquaintance addresses him as \"Marty,\" DeVito smiles in a friendly way, nods, and corrects him -- \"Martin.\"Dennis Farina arrives at LAX, strides purposefully to the sidewalk, arriving at a right angle to the curb. A taxi sits a few feet away to his left. Without looking, silently, Farina snaps his fingers and the driver pulls up until the rear door is directly in front of his fare. The cab driver is a non-person to Farina. So is everyone else, to everyone else, except to the extent that they can be useful.It's a movie that's almost completely without heart. It is to empathy what the Marx Brothers were to social niceties and that's what makes it so funny.\n",

            "Review 19: Get shorty is a hilarious film with a lot of brains. It's one of the funniest films ever. It has so many good performances, including John Travolta as Chili Palmer and Denis Farnia as Ray Barboni. A.K.A. Ray Bones. Chili Palmer is a more likable bad ass type character while Ray Bones has a lot of bad luck and is a foul mouth. Saying f*ck the entire film. Farnia does many things to Chil and the two are big enemies. For instance, there is a scene where Chili is in a restaurant and Ray Bones takes his jacket. so Chili goes to his apartment and breaks his nose. And still gets the jacket back. Chili Palmer is in the movie business. I am not going to get to much into the plot. I have liked every one of Barry Sonnefeld's films. Yes, I even liked Men in Black II, sue me I don't care. But films like Get Shorty and Big Trouble were my favorite of his films. Both films were very funny and clever. The first Get shorty film, is genius. The second one, not really that smart. Chili Palmer is a cool cat who should stay in the movie business. Every performance in the film is fantastic. But I really thought that Denis Farnia and John Travolta did the best. It's a fact, they were the best. Don't deny it.Get Shorty: ****/****\n",

            "Review 20: I realize some will disagree with 10/10.Given that this is one of my very favorite comedies, I had to do it.The best parts of this movie are the dialog and the mood.A lot of the dialog is lifted from the novel if memory serves. It's intelligent and funny. Almost no dialog falls flat.The mood, as I would call it is amazing. The jazz score sets a nice tone as does the overall style and the pace. It's cool, to use an overused term.Chili Palmer amazingly played by Travolta reminds me a bit of Bugs Bunny. Totally in control at all times, with everyone else looking a bit silly. Like Bugs Bunny, it's the total fantasy of being totally in control. Probably one of the more appealing aspects.The cast is full of stars who are given great lines to deliver as well.The characters are all fun.In short, I can't think of too many movies that are this enjoyable over the whole movie.I own the book, and have read part of it (it's signed by the author.) The movie is so good, that the book never quite holds my attention long enough to read it. I think if I had read the book first, maybe I would feel differently.Someone suggested watching Jackie Brown rather than this movie. They are both great, and totally different. I suggest seeing BOTH.\n",

            "Review 21: Now what does one make of this rather strange movie. What is the plot and if there is a plot, what is it? Get Shorty is not a mindless action flick, that is not what I am referring to when I am asking about a plot. Most action flicks generally have a plot, even though they are probably extremely shallow. Get Shorty, on the other hand, has a rather strange plot with some even stranger events.Chilli (John Travolta) is a loan shark who has been upset by another mafia boss in Miami named Ray Babone (Hal Linden). Chilli breaks Babone's nose and then shoots him just to let him know that he is not in the mood to be pushed around. Unfortunately Chilli's boss, Momo, dies in Brooklyn when he walks into a surprise party and has a heart attack. Babone then convinces him to go to Los Angeles to chase a laundry operator who owes him $300,000 after he allegedly died in a airplane crash. When Chilli gets to Los Angeles he is also asked by somebody in Las Vegas to get some money from a movie producer (Gene Hackman). When he breaks into the producer's house, he is struck with the movie making bug and decides that the current events would make a good movie. Thus he begins to try to drum up interest, mostly from a famous actor named Martin Wier (Danny DeVito) and gets involved with Wier's ex-wife who is an actress (Rene Ruso). Meanwhile another loan shark is after the producer for money that was lost at a casino.Pretty twisting little plot I thought and there were some quite funny scenes in the movie. It is the twisting plot that makes this movie shine. The major thing with the movie is a satirical look at Hollywood and the loansharking business. All of the films mentioned have really corny names suggesting the meaninglessness of the movies that are made. It is also shown as a bug that influences everybody that comes into the scene. Chilli and the LA loanshark are both caught by the producing bug and want to get into the film industry. Martin Wier is a typical actor and his personality is also satirised. He is shown Chilli's rent-a-car and decides that he likes it so much that he buys one himself. When they are having lunch, he orders everything for everybody and eats none of it suggesting that the actor always wants to be in control of the movie, even though it is the producer and the director that run the show. Then there is the ending where Ray Babone goes to the locker at LA airport and is caught by the DEA agents. This is twisted around in the film being made replacing the agents with Chilli, somebody much shorter, and a bad imitation of Babone. This goes to show the delusion that Hollywood creates. In a true story, the people become vague caricatures of the people that they are based upon, and are twisted to allow the famous actors to take the spot. Martin Wier is nothing like Chilli yet Chilli knows that to capture an audience, one must turn to a famous face.Then there is the film studio ending, the removal of the veil that shrouds Hollywood. It is revealed that all it is is a movie and any bad ending is meaningless because the antagonist is only an actor who walks away afterwards. No matter how evil this bad guy is and no matter how much he is hated, what happens in the movie is only an illusion. The bad guy is only an actor and his apparent death is just some ploy shot in front of the camera. In the end, they will all pack up and go home.Thus Get Shorty is a very intelligent and satirical movie. The bad guys are not threatening, but rather a caricature of the typical Hollywood villain. The movie is focused entirely on Chilli who is fearless and able to bend even the most intimidating person to his will. The most outstanding part of this movie is Gene Hackman's role. When I do not recognise the actor then that actor is doing a very good job. This was the case with Ed Harris in The Truman Show, and it is the case in this movie. Hackman has a famous face, yet it was a face that I did not recognise in this film.\n",

            "Review 22: At this time, John Travolta was riding high after Quentin Tarantino and \"Pulp Fiction\" had completely revitalized his career. He's full of poise and self-confidence in the role of \"Chili\" Palmer, a debt collector for the Miami mob who travels to L.A. on business. One of his targets is Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), a veteran producer of utter schlock who's looking to break into mainstream filmmaking with a better-than-average script. And Chili, who's a movie fan, realizes that connecting with Harry is his ticket into the movie business. He must still deal with various unsavoury types, but handles it all in style.Elmore Leonard is treated with a degree of respect by a talented cast & crew, led by director Barry Sonnenfeld. As a former cinematographer, Sonnenfeld knew how to make a visually rich film, and since his previous two pictures were the \"Addams Family\" feature films, he clearly had a knack for comedy, as well. He works from a solid Scott Frank adaptation of the Leonard novel, complete with a large amount of witty dialogue, and some effective digs at Hollywood and its \"types\". (Danny DeVito is a hoot as an egotistical movie star who enjoys talking about his acting process.) Even at an hour and 45 minutes, it never feels that long, due to excellent pacing and a great many compelling scenes.Travolta receives strong support from a well-chosen cast of famous faces and reliable character actors. Hackman is quite funny, although his character is quite senseless. Rene Russo is appealing as a former schlock starlet who has far more talent and savvy than her roles would have indicated. And get a load of this supporting lineup: Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, James Gandolfini (a few years before his subsequent stardom on 'The Sopranos'), David Paymer, Martin Ferrero, Miguel Sandoval, Jon Gries, and Linda Hart. Bette Midler appears uncredited; other famous performers make cameo appearances.Enhanced by a jaunty music score by John Lurie, \"Get Shorty\" is good, breezy fun.Followed by the sequel \"Be Cool\", and a TV series.Eight out of 10.\n",

His style is emulated almost to the point of plagiarism by Barry Sonnenfeld (although in a much less violent way), but this works to the film's advantage as what we end up with is a smart, sharp, and witty movie about the seedy side of Hollywood.Travolta is on fire, as is the rest of the cast, and they all work wonders with the great script. Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito, and Rene Russo play off each other like the pros they are, and their screen presence adds more fuel to already sizzling dialogue.A gem of a movie and no mistake.\n",

            "Review 1: Leaving Las Vegas (1995) **** (out of 4) Depressing account of a man (Nicholas Cage) who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and once there he strikes up a relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). Going back and watching this film after so many years had a lot of things going through my mind. Such as the first time I watched this it was in the theater as the second part of a double feature with DEAD MAN WALKING. Talk about a depressing four hours in the theater. The second thing it reminded me of was what a terrific actor Cage was and how at the time many people were calling him one of the greatest of his generation. I bring this up considering the type of films Cage is currently doing. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is without question a very dark and depressing film and it always amuses me that people attacked the picture for this. I mean, there are several films each year that shows the fun side of drinking so I always find it strange that so many could object to a film showing the ugly side. I can understand people not wanting to sit through a nearly two-hour suicide movie but at the same time those who can stomach the story are going to be shown one of the best performances from this era. Cage is simply marvelous as the alcoholic who goes on a death wish for reasons we're not fully told. It's funny but the screenplay really doesn't give us much insight to either character other than both are troubled, alone and find some sort of comfort with each other. This love story between the two certainly isn't all that casual or romantic but it's quite unique in its own way. The way Cage controls this character, his various emotions and the physical nature of his body falling apart are simply amazing to watch. It really reminds one of how great he can be when the material is right. Shue also turns in the best performance of her career and you can really see the pain in her eyes as this man she loves is slowly dying. Julian Sands is also quite effective in his few scenes. Director Mike Figgis does an extremely good job with the material but a lot of credit also needs to go towards his film score. LEAVING LAS VEGAS isn't a very pretty movie to watch but then again, why would anyone expect alcoholism to be pretty?\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 2: If Mike Figgis never made another film, and Nick Cage and Elizabeth Shue retired after making Leaving Las Vegas, they would have done so with impunity. Both actors are superb, and bring the excellent screenplay to life with the help of some masterful dramatic cinematography.Cage plays a suicidal alcoholic who has come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death, and Shue plays the unexpected problem - a prostitute who falls in love with him. The only reason this film did not receive a ten from me is the voice-over technique which was tastefully minimal, but, in my opinion, the only mistake the director made. It does help to provide closure, but I felt that closure was an unnecessary compromise here.This is not an entertaining film, and in truth, I am surprised by its popularity among typical audiences. It is a serious film, and a work of art, but fun is not to be found here. DO NOT see this film if you dislike feeling emotionally drained and ethically challenged, and DO NOT see it if you are very prone to boredom, or easily offended by sexual violence, substance abuse and the horror of daily life on the street. This is an intensely sad film about love shared by people who are caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a story of redemption and respect, found in improbable places. It is NOT a fun-filled frolicking romantic comedy, but rather, the opposite, and it achieves a beauty, dignity and power almost unique among films treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects.\n",

            "Review 3: Leaving Las Vegas is a very powerful character drama that happens to be the best acting Nicholas Cage has ever done. We are so used to his over-the-top performances, but this role is very reserved. He does play an alcohol addict, but he isn't crazy for the majority of the film and that's a relief. This film was made on a very cheap budget, but that doesn't matter when we get too involved in the story and the relationship between the two main characters.Mike Figgis's film is about a Hollywood screenwriter named Ben who loses everything thanks to his alcoholism. He decides to go to Las Vegas to literally drink himself to death and that's where he meets a prostitute, Sera. They form a relationship despite their issues and each realize they form a special bond with each other.The acting is very good. Nic Cage does a career role and his portrayal of an alcoholic is very realistic and disturbing. I'm perturbed on how much alcohol he drank in the film. Elizabeth Shue does very well as Sera and we are able to feel her pain despite her profession.Overall, this is a very surreal and realistic drama that focuses mightily on characterization. I don't like what each person does, but somehow the movie makes me feel bad for them and root for good things to happen to our main characters. Also, I really liked the look and the feel of the film. It gives out a more realistic feeling. Thanks to the raw, gritty, and powerful performances, this movie works on a high level. I rate this film 9/10.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 4: Remarkable. Touching. Riveting. Leaving Las Vegas is all of these and then some. I have not seen a film of this magnitude about loneliness and acceptance in such a while that I was in tears for much of the run time.Nicholas Cage is Ben, a man who has lost his wife and child, throws his job away, and takes all of his remaining money to buy as much liquor as possible and \"drink himself to death\" in the city of Las Vegas. He has given up all hope, with no wish to live, but for one reason or another, wants a companion to share in his misery, but not try to save him. He finds this companion in a hooker, Sera, played by Elizabeth Shue. They immediately form a strong relationship based on one night of talking about their lives. Sera in particular quickly grows attached to Ben, for no other reason than she has been alone her whole life and wants nothing more than to feel that want and need by someone.Cage won his first Oscar for his role as Ben, and how deserved it was. He was astounding, perfection, down to every single tick, the volume of his voice, the pain and tragedy buried in his eyes. I could not believe the extent of his role, the dedication and time he invested in bringing this character to life. Same goes for Elizabeth Shue, who with a simple glance at a person, she reveals her entire self, and no one even dares to notice except for Ben. This neediness is apparent, she wants to hold onto this relationship so badly, yet what makes their relationship work is total and complete acceptance of their respective decisions. He will not tell her to stop being a hooker, and she in return can never ask him to stop drinking. And it is in that factor that makes this film worth watching. To be totally accepted by those around them, to open themselves up to such an extreme.Leaving Las Vegas is a sobering film about connections, loneliness, acceptance, and a small little island of hope that is Ben and Sera. They are two good people, depicted in a world full of sorrows and misdeeds, who latch onto each other and never let go. They were nothing but ghosts, till that chance encounter, and became each others worlds. Cage and Shue bring these good people to life in such an extraordinary way, making Leaving Las Vegas a film to be treasured and remembered for years to come. I highly recommend this film.\n",

            "Review 5: Ben Sanderson is an alcoholic, who after getting released from his well paid screen writing position, heads to Vegas with his severance pay. Where he seriously plans to drink himself to death. But whilst cruising down the strip he meets Sera, a nicely turned out prostitute, and both troubled souls come together in an unlikely romance. Based around the semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, an alcoholic who committed suicide before the film made it to the screen, this is a sad, dark and deeply upsetting picture. Sanderson and his plight has no motive, we are not fed reasons for his nihilistic behaviour. We find him at the beginning of the film joyously hurtling thru a liquor market isle, promptly filling his shopping cart with bottles of liquor. From here on in we know that this is no ordinary film about an alcoholic trying to get off the booze, we are on a train to Bleakville, stops at Love and Liberation seem a very long way away. Enter Sera, the sweet and wholesome prostitute, who having escaped the abusive and borderline psycho pimp, Yuri, is herself in need of liberation. But can she carry the burden of both as this unlikely and almost certainly doomed romance starts to become significant? Nicholas Cage as Sanderson is terrific, very compelling, realistic and segueing from zany wired comedy to the desolation of Sanderson's death wish descent within a heart beat. Elisabeth Shue as Sera is also incredibly potent, if perhaps guilty of looking too pristine, and prompting questions of why she would be drawn to Ben's world anyway? Shue none the less works her socks off to make Sera sensitive and believable. Directed by Mike Figgis, who shot it beautifully in Super 16 film, the film won a Best Actor Academy Award for Cage, and garnered nominations for Best Actress {Shue} & Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay {both Figgis}. Massively popular and praised on release, it has lost none of the impact that it had back then. 8/10\n",

            "Review 6: Mike Figgis directed beautifully 'Leaving Las Vegas'... His film resulted audacious, fiercely realistic... Hollywood had great success with movies about alcoholism: \"The Lost Weekend\" which won four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Ray Milland and \"Days of Wine and Roses,\" depicting Jack Lemmon as a charming drunk who loses his job because of this, and brings his wife (Lee Remick) down with him...In 'Leaving Las Vegas,' Figgis captures the chaos inside an alcoholic divorcée... He shows the complexity of life and human relationships... He invites us to use our imaginations about a suicidal alcoholic... He never really explained how his character is bent on killing himself, nevertheless his powerful message remains a very sad one, extremely difficult to embrace... The final scene in a dark, filthy motel room rank as some of the most heartbreaking moments I have ever seen in film, and surely it will leave you terribly moved... Figgis treats his two leading characters tenderly... He never makes moral pronouncements, and to his credit, the film remains honest to the end, never sinking into sentimentality...His style as his story remembers me Marco Ferreri's greatest international success, 'La Grande Bouffe' (Blow-Out), a black and highly flatulent comedy (that won the Grand Jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973) about four middle-aged men who gather in a well-appointed villa to eat themselves to death...'Leaving Las Vegas' is the depressing love story of a failed drunken writer and a self-assured $500-a-night young hooker with whom he crosses paths... It is an appeasing tale of a dedicated drunk who downs entire bottles of hard liquor in several gulps... He is on the way down and he recognizes it... He is an ecumenical drinker who wants to destroy everything that remains of his old life... He fills his supermarket jumbo cart with as much booze as possible, and moves for Vegas to literally drink himself to death... Nicolas Cage is remarkable as Ben Sanderson, the alcoholic who is resolute and actually thoughtful about his self-destruction..Ben admits he has nothing to live for and he wants to die... He swills vodka from the bottle in the shower... He drinks greedily at the bottom of a swimming pool... He drinks, and drinks, 'til there's no more... And when he discovers that the Casino does not offer the Bloody Mary's that he asks, he explodes, overturning the table of Blackjack where he was gambling... He wakes up at night shaking so much he can merely crawl to the refrigerator and intensely swallows Vodka mixed with a little orange juice... Elisabeth Shue proves to be a revelation as Sera.. A polite, beautiful, and sensitive blonde woman who prides herself on being just a high-class call girl... Nevertheless her vulnerable character is very puzzling for her terrible lifestyle, and her strange desperate attachment to a sadistic pimp Yuri Butso... Sera meets Ben and inexplicably finds herself attracted to him... She soon develop a rich closeness that can nearly be described as love... Ben continues to tell her that true love between them could never happen... After Yuri is soon out of the way by Russian thugs, she takes Ben under her wing, and attempts to fill a need in her life much like Ben fills his needs with liquor... Both share a common bond of misery and loneliness... Sera cares for Ben enough to handle his drunken bouts of coldness... She complies to Ben's own terms and vows to never dissuade him from his suicidal goal... Out of sheer love, she even buys him a silver flask for a present, while, inside, she is desperate to find some way to change his course as well as her own... In one of the most revealing scenes at a desert resort, she drowns herself in sunlight and liquor to seduce Ben... She tries to love him, and in his infrequent getaways of semi-sobriety, he attempts to love her back... The opportunity is shattered as Ben, without an ability or desire to change, becomes for her a tragic portrait of life without hope... How foolish of her to push him to select...Shue keeps, all the way, an intriguing character extremely human... She is good and tender... Never tough or cynical... Her observations, without dialog, suggest just a sliver of expectation... In the final outcome, this dream hooker is the heart of the story... The Academy showed their appreciation by giving her a best actress nomination...\"Leaving Las Vegas\" is pain, isolation and honesty... An unusual picture of human desperation and impotency... A study of acceptance, resignation and despair of an amazing two characters... An examination of what happens when two lovers are caught in cycles of self-destruction... The film is extremely well written, directed and acted... The chemistry between Cage and Shue is sizzling... They are able to solve their existential frustrations by connecting in perfect harmony, and yet they are still completely alone... 'Leaving Las Vegas' has some film noir feel by moments, specially during the dark alleyways and hookers, where its neon signs are seedy, its nights perpetual, and the glitter absent... Figgis' camera moves as fluidly as the alcohol guzzles bottle after bottle down Cage's throat... The music adds plenty to the motion picture with ballads playing a large role in the odd romance... Like Chaplin and Woody Allen, Figgis molds his movie by using his own music...In an ironic twist of events, the book's author John O'Brien actually committed suicide in 1994, two weeks after selling the movie rights... He never got to see his vision realized on the screen... Director, Mike Figgis finished the film as a tribute...\n",

            "Review 7: Long before he became a walking talking meme that is now more known for his willingness to jump on board just about any film that comes his way, Nicolas Cage was at one stage a very serious and well-regarded actor, reaching a pinnacle with his Oscar winning performance as alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter Ben Sanderson in Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas.One of the most deeply depressing and bleak movies to come out of the Hollywood system in the time period of its release, Figgis's raw and confronting adaptation of John O'Brien's novel allowed Cage to go all in as the death wish seeking Sanderson, who flees the sights and sounds of Los Angeles for the casino laden streets of Las Vegas where he finds potential redemption and meaning in a relationship with Elisabeth Shue's kinder-hearted prostitute Sera.An unconventional romance in an untypical narrative, Cage and Shue are both as good as they've been in their Oscar winning and nominated roles respectively, even if its hard to know how their performances would be received in today's climate with some of Figgis's directional choices ageing poorly and Vegas's unrefined nature feeling as though its lost some of its lustre in the 25 years on from the films well received initial release that saw it become a surprise box office draw and awards darling.No doubt the film provides the now mostly irrelevant Shue with her best role before she disappeared into bit parts in mainly direct to video efforts while Cage has rarely found a more suitable character to inhabit than Ben who gives him time as both a wide eyed drunken maniac and a solemnly drawn recluse who longs for nothing more than the sweet peace of death.The two performers who virtually share most of the films screen-time between themselves are key components of the films success in keeping you engaged as the films incessantly bleak and almost light free affair makes for rough viewing throughout, viewers enjoyment being dependent on how much sorrow and sadness they can take in one sitting.You get the feeling that had Vegas been made today much would've changed about how it handles and films various tough and confronting moments but as it stands its still an important piece of the 90's cinematic puzzle, even if its awards and plaudits could be called into question as it stands.Final Say -Some would argue that Leaving Las Vegas is a career peak moment for its leading man and is undoubtedly the best work of its leading lady and director but this raw and bleak affair hasn't benefited from the time that's passed since its initial release even if its still an at times powerful examination of self-destructive souls.3 bar-tending Danny Huston's out of 5\n",

            "Review 8: Hollywood screenwriter Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is a hopeless drunk and self-destructing. He loses his job and his family. He decides to destroy everything in his home, drive to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. He runs into call girl Sera (Elisabeth Shue) and hires her. Her abusive pimp Yuri (Julian Sands) had followed her out from L.A. He's broke and on the run from a gang. Ben and Sera begin a relationship accepting each other's flaws. However these flaws overtake them in the end.This is a movie about a drunk and a hooker with a heart of gold. Cage and Shue make this more than the simple cliché it sounds like. They infuse these characters with humanity. They give two great performances.\n",

            "Review 9: To me, this is one of the best romantic films that you can get your hands on. If you are interested in seeing a pure love, one that is not focused purely on sex, but instead emotional and mental connectiveness, then this is the film for you. While others will argue that this is not the best date film, I would beg to differ. Leaving Las Vegas would be a perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer. It is a gripping story of realistic love, and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to someone. It is about dreams, companionship, and the hurdles of everyday romance. This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our society still has a shimmering light of hope and love. Director Mike Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters the right elements to build upon the \"classic\" love-story moments, while giving it a flavor uniquely his own. Figgis' mixture of gritty Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their transformation into love. I think that is what really captured me on this film, was that it was similar to the love stories that Hollywood continually releases, except it gave us two tragic characters instead of these bubbly, money isn't everything, characters that seem to be repetitive cogs in the Hollywood machine.Let me explain this further. When you think of a love story, what are the elements that you consider? You have a guy and a girl (normally), they have this coincidental moment where they find their common bond, they are held back by either an internal or external dilemma, there is a factor of insecurity, and finally the dramatic ending where the two rush together at a predisclosed location (normally an airport). Does that sound familiar in any way? These are all elements that you can find in LLV. I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and for some odd reason it was this viewing that it just seemed to click for me. This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone. While most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute, I saw it as the classic story of love. All the elements are present. Ben and Sera coincidentally meet one night, both seeking companionship and without the pressures of sex, they immediately form this bond that will never be broken. Through Ben's drunkenness, he remembers her and continually wants to see her. They both have internal factors that hold them back, Sera's is prostitution while Ben's is his drinking. Even through there are these factors, they still find themselves together. That feeling of insecurity is even there when Sera arrives home one night to find Ben with someone else. It all seems to fit. Then there is the amazing ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe. These two are in love, and it isn't this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.The only unnecessary moments that I felt could have been fine-tuned were those involving Julian Sans. I just couldn't capture his character. I needed a bit more back-story or perhaps more interactions between him and Sera. Something was missing that distracted from the scenes that they shared. Outside of this one element, the rest of the film was purely flawless and even at times carnal. For example, when Sera has the opportunity to be on her own, she chooses to forgo her independence and be with Ben. Shue and Figgis both demonstrate that perhaps Sera is not in love with Ben, but instead the concept of a man wanting to be with her because of who she is. It is obvious that Sera seeks companionship, and probably has never had it all her life, when suddenly Ben struts into the picture. This may explain why she continues to work when she doesn't have to. She is used to the job, she thrives for the intensity, and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love with Ben. Figgis doesn't come out and give you a reason why Sera continues along her path, but instead leaves it up to your imagination and enjoyment. Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the Waves, Love Liza, and All the Real Girls. This is a love story with so many different human elements coming to you at once that the average viewer would probably ignore the signs and see this as a depressing film. While it isn't the lightest film of the ages, it does prove that \"Love is a very splendid thing\".I cannot end this review without at least mentioning the amazing acting done by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. The chemistry between them is rare in Hollywood. I felt that these two really made this film and were just not placed in their roles to sell tickets. Cage really felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly with her secrets and heart. It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for his role in this film, and while I am sure we will never see him take a role like this again (thanks to summer blockbusters), it was good to see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre. The same goes for Shue. While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.Grade: ***** out of *****\n",

            "Review 10: It's not a movie I could bear to watch very often, because it's sad to see people destroy themselves. But Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are riveting to watch here. As a person who has a past involvement in alcohol and substance abuse, I found Cage's performance especially compelling, and after watching him in this one, I am sure glad that lifestyle is behind me!The chemistry between these two is really great, two people that need each other in different ways, trying to cope with how screwed up their lives have become. Very real performances, if you're faint-of-heart be ready for some strong words, and not just obscenities. Wow! They really lay it on the line. Great performances by two of my favorites.\n",

            "Review 11: Nic Cage is hit and miss with me. This is him at his best. His pain, apathy, hopelessness, helplessness, pathetic-ness (if that's a word) is heart wrenching. You can't help but pity him but at the same time you know he's on the correct path -- for him. It's sad. But beautiful at the same time because of his relationship with her. The thing that makes this performance so amazing to me is that he's usually such a loud, boisterous character, sometimes to the point of obnoxiousness but here he is so understated. If it's not the best performance of all time, it is definitely his best performance. For me.\n",

            "Review 12: The strength of this film is that you like the people, despite their enabling and their weakness. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of this disease I've ever seen and while the movie made me crawl, it was more than effective. Nick Cage's character recognizes all that he is. He has come to terms with his self-destructiveness and warns people to stay out of his life. He has flags up everywhere. His counterpart makes the mistake of falling in love with him. She goes through the hell that every person who has a significant relationship with an alcoholic goes through. Her life is no bed of roses and so she embraces his love and companionship, but like the proverbial snake, he is still a snake: it is his nature. The acting here is superb-- the characters so real we have trouble watching them. They move through the \"normal\" world. She grows to believe that if she sticks with him, he will come around. She can't overcome the puzzle of the control that the booze has on him. To her, if she is that important to him, he will change. There's the rub. See this movie but be prepared for what it is about.\n",

            "Review 13: I've seen this film 5 or 6 times. It occurred to me on the last viewing that it could be the ultimate Touched by an Angel  Ben's time in Las Vegas, that is. I believe author John O'Brien thought he was living through a hallucination in the final throes of his diseased life.The possibility rises out of several conspicuous dynamics in the film.First, that Ben's life was invested developing Hollywood drama prior to being dismissed by his boss, who will clearly miss his talent and personality in the office, a talent singularly broken by the ravages of alcoholism. He is good at inventing and developing \"story\". If his occupation had been Investment Banking or Teaching, I'd feel differently. But John O'Brien bore him with a Hollywood mind. That lit the flame for me.That Ben repeatedly calls Sera his angel during his demise - as he enjoys the best of - and endures the worst of - Las Vegas living. It is possible that all of it is a hallucination during the final pathetic act of his life. The invention of Sera makes his passing bearable, doable, a possible goal for him.That Sera endures the college team horrors, discuses her relationship with the off-camera therapist to whom she confesses her soul-deep love for Ben ... even the problems with her pimp and landlord constitute deep back story in the mind of a man with a talent for such invention, desperate to flesh out the reasons why this angel will escort him to the next world. In my last analysis, she is an angel divined in his fertile mind to embody all of the good people and events in his life (the wealth flashback memories, e.g.). Sera has come to take him out while steeling the love in his heart. She sees him for what he is, because that's what responsible angels do.This is a work with metaphor far beyond the veneer of the surface dialog. It's a film demanding to be viewed more than once. Or perhaps, I'm just going nuts, have lost it and I'm hallucinating in my own right.Either way, enjoy. 10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 14: After losing his job as a screenwriter for boozing, a man decides to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. But what he didn't expect was to meet Sera, a prostitute with problems of her own.This film is pretty highly acclaimed and Nicolas Cage received an Oscar for his role as the drunk. Personally, I don't know that Cage deserved the award for this one. Later on in the film his acting gets better, but the first half just seems like Cage being himself more than anything. The opening scene of him loading a shopping cart with booze is more comedic than serious. And drinking a bottle of booze as a cop drives past? Better roles he's played: \"Weather Man\", \"Lord of War\" and \"Adaptation\". This was more akin to \"Trapped in Paradise\", hardly a notable role.Elizabeth Shue, likewise, was questionable. I thought she did a much better job than Cage, but was still not a break-out role by all means. I think any number of actresses could easily have handled her role as well or better.I was also disappointed because the film has a strong anti-drinking message, but I have to say the movie really made me want to drink. I have no doubt many people have played a drinking game to this one. So, mission not accomplished.Criticisms aside, it was a good movie. I really enjoyed watching it even if I didn't think it was outstanding. The story was interesting, the characters fun, the camera-work was quite good and the Vegas scenery was spectacular. So it wasn't like it was a punishment to sit through. Cage is entertaining and Shue is quite attractive in her own way (though her most attractive role will always be in \"The Saint\").I suppose I'd say you should see this movie, but I'd ask you to decide for yourself is this deserved awards. I just didn't see it. Which, I guess, is more a complaint about the Academy than the film itself. But it put me in the wrong mindset -- expecting some mind-blowing drama and just getting a film not unlike which I've seen many times before.\n",

            "Review 15: Having recovered from the mind-numbing Heat, a supposed character study, I was eager to sink my teeth into a different 1995 gem and I found it here with Leaving Las Vegas. With only two important characters, the entire film rests heavily on the shoulders of Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, and neither of them disappoint.Of the two, Nicolas Cage is the Oscar winner and the truly deserving one at that. He is simply hypnotic as Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic so far gone he doesn't even remember why he wants to die. His withdrawal scenes are so real they are upsetting, whereas his drunken charisma is so real its almost funny. The balance that Cage strikes really highlights how tragic his character really is. He conveys hatred and rage and loneliness and despair, and you will be so sad yet so hooked that its impossible to look away. Elisabeth Shue gets off to a slower start than Cage, but she is still an endearing, emotional character, capable of great things.The writing is very good, giving Cage the perfect, pitiful dialogue in order to serve his woeful character, and even throws in a hypnotic monologue or two. The best thing that Figgis achieves in this film is his cruel and deliberate intersplicing of mood-killing incidents (invariably caused by alcohol) between the moments of love and passion that Shue and Cage share. It is a relentless reminder that their love story is completely doomed. Sting's My One and Only Love is all over this film, which I thought was a very good choice, in addition to the beautiful and haunting score.The final act focuses a little too much on Shue and not enough on Cage, and whilst their final scene together was appropriately pathetic to suit the tragedy of the film, I couldn't help but feel less engaged. I also didn't enjoy Shue's constant commentary, given that it doesn't really go anywhere.But between the raw passion of Nicholas Cage and the uncompromising guiding hand of Mike Figgis, any complaints I could ever have otherwise found in Leaving Las Vegas are completely washed away.\n",

            "Review 16: I tend to give Nicolas Cage a bad reputation because within the last, maybe six years, he's done nothing but forgettable and laughably bad films. The films themselves are poor, and he is not much better. Leaving Las Vegas is for all the people that believe Nicolas Cage hasn't done a good movie. Seeing this before, but rewatching it for the first time in years I can prove that if Cage is handed the right material he can be a good actor.Cage plays Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic who recently had a crisis in his family. We see a picture of him, his son, and wife. We never exactly know why he is so upset, and the movie characters neglect to ask him any question. It could either be divorce or death. I'm going to assume death since he never hear from the wife or kid. Ben is a screenwriter, and once is alcoholism hits the breaking point, he is fired and moves to Las Vegas.His plan? Drink. Drink nonstop and ask no questions about it. Drink himself to death. He meets a hooker named Sera (Shue) who is run by her abusive pimp Yuri (Sands). If neglecting to bring home a fair amount of money Sera will be cut with a knife on her thighs. Both have their share of troubles, and Ben only seems to be calm when she's around.The film is a tragedy. This is the only role Nic Cage won an Oscar for and he's absolutely brilliant in it. Watching this in 1995, you'd probably never guess he was bound for winners like Drive Angry 3D and Ghost Rider in his future. Elisabeth Shue, who I enjoyed so much in The Trigger Effect, a hated suspense film that has a dark feel to it like this, was amazing as well and deserved the Best Actress win.The score is true Las Vegas jazz. Certain scenes with music are very well shot, and you may find yourself rewinding them just to make sure you pay attention to the actors rather than the soundtrack.The solace Ben finds in Sera is odd, but not unbelievable. Sometimes when your liver is about to give in and your head isn't on straight, the people you find comfort in are people you probably never would've looked at in your lifetime. Against all odds, Ben can get possibly one last friend out of his life before the drinking takes over.Shot on only 16mm, the high definition transfer is a little grainy, and I noticed slight audio problems. That doesn't deteriorate from the film's quality, it's just a little odd. Leaving Las Vegas is a true down-note masterpiece as it showcases realism, and Ben's drunkenness without being too comical or too over the top to believe. With outstanding performances from both the leads, a soundtrack, and Casino-like scenery make for an unexpected and truly gripping film.Starring: Nicolas Cage, Elizabeth Shue, and Julian Sands.

Uncompromisingly bleak and powerful portrayal of unconditional love between two tragic misfits.  Cage in a bravura performance, that justifiably garnered him a Best Actor Oscar, vows to give up on life and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death where he meets and falls for pretty victimized hooker Shue (the performance of her career, and Best Actress nominee) who decides to love him for what he is.  Excellent rapport and believably realistic performances and excellent adaptation of John O' Brien's semi-autobiographical novel of total despair.  O' Brien committed suicide shortly after his novel was being produced into a film.  Filmed in grainy 16MM and blown up to 35MM gives it an all too natural look.

            "Review 18: \"Leaving Las Vegas\" is an insightful, harrowing experience about the binding forces of true romance, the power of encouragement and compassion, and the tragic effects of alcoholism. The performances are absolutely astounding: Nicholas Cage delivers one of the most unforgettable, genuine, and human performances ever captured on film (a well-deserved Oscar for every reason), and Elisabeth Shue, as his soul provider and protector through the trauma of his alcoholic turmoil is sentimental, passionate, and definitely deserving of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1995, providing us with the eye of Ben Sanderson's heart and soul, as his equally troubled lover who has pledged to stay with him through tears and trials. Director Mike Figgis is intensely effective in following the many turmoils of Sanderson as he copes with terminal alcoholism, even going so far as to declaring he will \"drink himself to death in Las Vegas\", and the effects of his struggle upon his functions, health, and spirit, as well as the corresponding attributes of his loyal lover, Sara. I'm certain that anyone who has experienced the turmoil of alcoholism or has been deeply involved with such an abuser will gravely appreciate the realism and depth of this film to address the egregious effects of drinking constantly, and how this alcoholism tears many lives literally apart. I was horrified by Sanderson's dependence upon alcoholism as a substitute for happiness and control, and Nicholas Cage's uncanny human performance, with all of his appropriate, convincing twitches and erratic movements, enhanced the compassion and torment I felt for this character, who has literally surrendered his life to this terrible disease of alcoholism. We gasp in horror as we see Sanderson taking a shower with a bottle of gin in hand, and trembling to the refrigerator for a bottle of vodka: these are the true, tragic symptoms of alcoholism, and this film does an excellent job in addressing them. A brilliant, tragic, yet extremely essential study of the disease of alcoholism and how it can destroy every aspiration, every desire, and every state of consciousness we have within ourselves, when we are constantly craving \"one more bottle of vodka\" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week... Nicholas Cage delivers one of the most heartfelt and eerily convincing performances in the history of film, and this is one lamentable, subliminal look at one of the saddest and unnecessary addictions in humans: striving to either enhance, better, or in this case, destroy their lives in constantly drinking intoxicating and deadly substances. Sanderson to Sara: \"You can never make me stop drinking\"--- the sad, yet frighteningly real state of mind of a disparaged, hopeless, alcoholic. **** out of ****\n",

            "Review 19: To call Nicolas Cage's character an alcoholic would be a disservice to alcoholics everywhere. I mean, even a raging drunk has to come up for air sometimes, but Ben Sanderson (Cage) knocked down bottles of booze with the speed of The Flash, torching the memories of his past and sliding into the darkest oblivion imaginable. There's some measure of humanity in the story when Ben discovers a Las Vegas street walker named Sera (Elizabeth Shue), who offers him her love and friendship because of an ethereal connection she makes with the down and out former screenwriter. Yet even their tender moments together and the poignant background music do little to hide the fact that these two damaged souls are derelicts from the human race, and as it turns out in Ben's case, beyond saving both spiritually and bodily. The film may be of service to demonstrate how low one can go before succumbing to the depths of despondency and despair, and that there may be hope around the corner if only one were to reach out and recognize a helping hand. But this one goes in the other direction, and serves as a reminder that relentlessly abusing one's body and spirit can only end one way.\n",

            "Review 20: Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are truly stunning in the 1995 film, Leaving Las Vegas, a powerful and tragic drama from director Mike Figgis(Internal affairs). The two stars give the best performances of their careers, in one of the best films of their careers.Cage plays Ben, a man who has officially hit rock bottom and has gone to Vegas in a plan to drink himself to death. Until he meets Sera(played by Elisabeth Shue), a lonely hooker who falls for Ben. The film focuses on their relationship, pretty much.You really grow to hate Ben, and you really grow to love Sera. And in the end, you feel really sad for her. The whole film is real. The film is mainly about two sad people who are having a midlife crisis, and watching them is intoxicating(no pun intended I swear).Cage really earned his Oscar here, even though I sort of hated him. I think that Shue definitely should've won for her wonderfully sad performance here. We grow to truly care about these characters, and thats mainly why the ending is so sad.This is a powerful and wonderful film that will keep you thinking about it long after its over. There is a lot to admire about it, but the main thing to admire is the remarkable performances by Nicolas Cage and the sadly forgotten Elisabeth Shue.A\n",

            "Review 21: There's a deal you make with an artist: they get to satisfy themselves but they also have to satisfy us.What's interesting is the balance Figgis has struck. There's a whole lot more emphasis on the film-specific elements: blocking, transitions, particularly apt sound and soundtrack, in out in in out cadences.The ordinary theatrical elements are slighted: dialog, character development, old fashioned story values. This balance works for me in `Time Code,' because the filmic experiment is so intriguing. And a similar balance works with `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,' a film congruent in respects other than the city. But the balance completely fails here. I don't care about Cage, or his character. No greater focus is raised. There is a successful evocation of style, but it is wasted. As contrast, `Fight Club,' raised a much more intriguing and troubling world. The acting doesn't impress me so much. Playing a drunk or a mental incompetent is a lesser art, and it is a rare film where illustrious acting can alone make the trip worthwhile.Figgis is interesting, and I'll go out of my way to watch his fuses, but he hasn't connected them to anything explosive yet.\n",

Figgis has directed with a modernistic style that alternates between shocking jump cuts and infinitely long dissolves, with plenty of white-outs and slow motion shots in between.  This sort of directorial display too often accomplishes nothing except to irritate the viewer and draw attention to itself -- \"Look, Ma, I got a camera!\"  In this case, however, the hallucinatory effect is appropriate to what's happening on the screen.  The tricks work.  In a motel office, Cage stares at the scarlet neon sign, \"The Whole Year Inn,\" which changes to, \"The Hole You're In.\"  It sounds cheap, and it might be, in another context, but here it slips painlessly into your perception. He's gotten good performances too.  Well, really there are only two, and a bunch of cameos.  Shue has a kind of Teutonic attractiveness, and the muscles that reveal her gymnast past to go with it.  She isn't gorgeous, thank Bog, but her face is extremely expressive.  (She doesn't get very many lines, as far as that goes.)  When this woman looks stricken, she really has a stricken look.  Her voice sounds unpolished by, say, Meryl Streep standards.  And her pronunciation has a quality peculiar to the emerging generation; many of her vowels undergo what I believe linguists call back gliding, so that \"move,\" for instance, becomes \"mewve.\"  It's not unpleasant to listen to.  And her scenes with an unseen shrink sound authentically improvised.  She does a better job than Jane Fonda did in a similar setting in \"Klute.\"  Cage is always an interesting actor, given to taking occasional risks that don't pay off.  Here he doesn't stylize the character overmuch. He's a career alcoholic, and he's particularly good at that launch window that lies between having enough booze to make you feel confident and gregarious on the one hand, and too pooped to pop on the other.  It's a fine performance.  The cameos include Lou Rawls, Mariska Hargity, R. Lee Ermy, inter alia. The story itself is based, as I understand, on an autobiography, but there must have been a great deal of fantasy mixed in with the straight exposition.  The effects of alcoholism are adequately conveyed, both through the director's technique and through the incidents described.  The guy is an impotent drunk.  And it's not just a case of Brewer's Droop.  Career alcoholics simply can't rise to the occasion, drunk or sober, and unfortunately there is evidence that the condition persists even after the alcoholic has been sober for years.  It isn't much fun being a drunk.  It takes a lot of work.  And there are very few moments in one's career that would seem humorous to an observer, unlike the cockroach scene in \"Under the Volcano.\"  When Shue takes him in, as she would a crippled old dog, he describes to her what life with a drunk is like, and he lays it on the line. Two demonstrations are especially poignant.  Cage overturns a blackjack table and gets thrown out.  And, when he and Shue are at a desert motel, they engage in voluptuous embraces at poolside.  When they finally get up to go to their room, perhaps to make love for the first time, Cage turns back, saying, \"Let me get a drinkie,\" and topples backward onto a glass-topped table, smashing it.  The smiling motel manager tells Shue not to bother sweeping up the glass, she'll take care of it, and meanwhile get out of here by tomorrow.  The unbelievable part is that a practiced hooker should fall for an impotent sloppy drunk, and stick with him through all the travails that such an arrangement involves, until he expires in a shabby motel room. This is what I meant when I used the word \"fantasy\" before.  It's the kind of thing every agonizingly lonely juice head wishes would happen to him, but it never does.  Also unbelievable is the last scene.  Cage, dying on a bed, begins masturbating.  Shue takes over for him and they evidently manage to raise an erection between them and consummate their love for each other. Then he dies. The score is worth mentioning.  It consists almost entirely of long old-fashioned melancholic love songs -- \"Angel Eyes,\" \"My One and Only Love,\" and so on.  The singers are backed up not by orchestras but by a few instruments -- piano, bass, sometimes winds or brass.  The kind of combo you hear in Las Vegas lounges.  The songs are almost constant.  At first it's a distraction but by the end of the film you've gotten used to hearing the melodies and lyrics and the reflection of loss they represent. Despite the story, I wouldn't call the movie depressing.  Sad, maybe, is a more apt description.\n",

            "Review 23: Nicolas Cage won a Best Actor Oscar playing a screenwriter and miserable alcoholic who hopes to drink himself to death; Elisabeth Shue was Oscar-nominated as the Las Vegas prostitute who tries to be his surrogate guardian angel. \"Leaving Las Vegas\", an adaptation of John O'Brien's novel by writer-director Mike Figgis, is a well-produced, well-acted drama that takes a awhile to get its bearings, eventually becoming a moving human tragedy. The opening moments introducing the characters are painfully under-directed; when he has no one to ground him, Cage can be a rambling boor (even doing a little shimmy in the supermarket, he is less a character than Nicolas Cage the actor just cutting up). Shue is very moving once Figgis dispenses with her pimp, and also with his penchant for fancy directorial flourishes that don't set any particular mood. By the second hour, the pieces start falling into place and Cage gets to do some great, high-wire dramatic acting. \"Leaving Las Vegas\" takes time finding its niche but Figgis and his cast finally capture the material's essence. It's a rewarding journey. **1/2 from ****\n",

            "Review 24: One of my favorite movies of all time. It makes it invaluable for anyone who has an insider's perspective, or for those who have ever been affected by such people and events. Normally I only watch a movie once, no matter how good it is. But I can re-visit and view this work as many times as I like, with it seeming to be the first viewing. Mike Figgis brought together a work of genius. Cage researched the essence of his character to portray it authentically for us. Shue was the icing on the cake in this story. This movie is a mesmerizing experience. To have captured the couldn't care less (except for the love of booze) attitude of Cage, as he attempts to drink himself to death, is a great achievement. There is no redemption, no saving, no moralizing. It is as it is. Alcoholism with all its devastation.\n",

            "Review 25: This is a heartbreaking movie. So much so that I found myself in tears at times just by the look of longing, and the sorrow knowing how futile it all is, between Ben (Nic Cage) and Sera (Elisabeth Shue). There's one such scene where they're at a food court. They seem to be in some good spirits, and Ben pulls out a little present (adorably, if just for a moment, 'magically' from behind her ear) and it's a pair of earing's. He puts them on her ear lobes and whispers something to her that is quite touching. The look between the two of them only lasts for about ten to fifteen seconds (which, in movie time, may seem long), but it speaks so much as to their twisted condition of a relationship, and how much affection Sera does feel for Ben despite everything she has to put up with with him. Still could be worse, but it certainly won't get better, not by a long shot.I get moved in a film, such as Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, when the characters have genuine feelings to one another, and, perhaps, there isn't the usual feeling that things will work out in the end. This isn't, for recent example, Crazy Heart. There's no telling really how Leaving Las Vegas will end, only that it will be in tragedy, for one or both of these souls. One is an ex-screenwriter ('ex' being at the start of the film, due to Ben's incessant drinking) who ventures to Las Vegas because he just needs to drink himself to death. Period. He's cashed his last checks, sold his car and burned his belongings. And yet Ben- via Cage's genuinely fearless performance- is not completely a down-and-out case personality wise. He can have his charms, he can be with it and hip... and other times the worst drunk you'd never want to meet at a bar or a casino.The other, Sera, is a prostitute, plain and simple, who works for a Russian fellow who treats her like s*** and, in the end, tells her to leave for good when it looks as if his own goose will be cooked by mobsters. She has little place to turn to, aside from her own turns at tricks, but she finds a connection somehow with this guy Ben. He's a genuine article, no BS, just a guy wanting to drink and to have someone to drink with (not sex, really, though the passion waxes and wanes). Figgis follows these two on this path that is inexorable. And at the same time he never asks us to really care about these people in the kind of artificial or forced way that we might get in a more \"Hollywood\" movie. Often a screenwriter will be asked when writing something \"What's the obstacles your character(s) will face in the story?\" In the case of Leaving Las Vegas, it's \"Is there anything left in the downward spiral?\" The film is a gorgeous, haunting feat of tragedy, as deep and involving as any film imaginable in the 90's (maybe not quite Schindler's List, but it's up there). The music by Figgis himself is a great jazzy mixture of tunes, sometimes with an upbeat tempo and other times the saddest music in the world (take that Guy Madden!) And the cinematography is to die for, so to speak, as he takes his 16mm stock and gets all of the moments that matter in such dark motel rooms and shiny Las Vegas nights. Hell, there's even a scene near the end, when Sera finally comes back to Ben after kicking him out, and in part it's the cinematography that makes one (or rather, me), sob like a baby. This film's got soul.As for the acting, it's almost untouchable when looking at not only that year of 1995, but the decade. Nicolas Cage has many bright spots in his career, but rarely did he give something as all-around well rounded as this in terms of playing the field emotionally. He can be funny, crazy, dour, tragic, even cute, and sometimes just the most happy-sad creature to walk the planet. You want to see why Nic Cage matters after years of trudging through Hollywood, come back to this as a reminder of what an intense guy this is. And Shue also hits it out of the park as the damaged but endearing Sera, who is earnest, kind, smart, but also knows that she, in a way like Ben, can't stop what she's started. When the two of them click on screen, you can't turn away. Last Tango in Paris comes to mind as a comparison, and even then it's not quite as passionate and moving.\n",

            "Review 1: Just kidding, I rented 12 Monkeys the other day because I am a huge Bruce Willis fan and I heard some things about the film. Some good and some bad, but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed, this movie had everything in it: action, drama, sci-fi, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really got to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character, who was crazy, and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary, but very good and a wake up call.James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below, but scientists send James to the past of 1990(really meaning to send him to '96), to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, of course no one believes him, he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more, and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Like I said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. But the whole movie was just great, the cast, the sets, just the whole picture was a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day, ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.9/10\n",

            "Review 2: In the future humans exist underground, the surface having become uninhabitable due to the release of a virus years before in 1996. The ruling classes are scientists and large sections of the population are held as prisoners in tiny cells; prisoners who \"volunteer\" to help work out what happened back in 1996 that killed off 99% of the population. Requiring information about the visit, James Cole is sent back to 1996 to gather what information he can. However, sent to 1990 by accident, Cole finds himself in a mental hospital where he meets From the very start this film marks itself out as being very much a Terry Gilliam product and those who hate his work will probably dislike this film for the same reason. However, pleasing people like that is not my concern and 12 Monkeys is actually one of Gilliam's most accessible films as it sets his imaginative style within a narrative that is satisfyingly complex and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. The story is not perfect though, the connection to the start is nice but the ultimate twist behind the virus just seems to have been thrown in to keep the film tidy; a minor complaint though because even then the main thrust of the story (Cole) keeps it together. The twisting plot plays with both Cole's and our sense of reality and it is genuinely gripping from start to finish Gilliam's direction is superb, whether it be the realistic world of the 1990's filmed with clever angles and shots or the wonderfully twisted world of the future, it is all excellent and was such a pleasant find in my local cinema at the time.The film benefits from great turns from the cast. Willis was having a bit of a career resurrection in the mid-90's when several films showed us that he could actually act  for me, 12 Monkeys was one of them. Willis is superb as he spins from madness to sanity and back again; he underplays all the way and is so much better than the wise-cracking everyman that he is better known for. Pitt is just as good but in a different way. Getting an Oscar nomination that he deserved, Pitt risks overdoing it but pushes his crazy performance as far as he can without being indulgent  I'm not saying he is perfect but I would could this as one of his best performances to date. Stowe is very much in the shadow of these two but she holds her own well. Morse, Seda, Meloni and Plummer are all good in minor roles but really the film belongs to the lead three  Willis in particular and Pitt in a great supporting role.Overall this is a great sci-fi; the story is great and is only helped by Gilliam's imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong, with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat, imaginative, engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam's films, it stands out as one of the best American sci-fi's of the past few decades.\n",

            "Review 3: Twelve Monkeys is typically Terry Gilliam, loaded with the director's trademark quirky visuals, and, as such, should get right up my nose (I'm not a huge fan of his hallucinatory, surreal style, to say the least). And yet I still love this unusual time travel tale: it's got great performances, with a particularly strong turn from the then up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and Gilliam's chaotic storytelling actually suits the inherent madness of the whole movie. The twisty-turny plot keeps the viewer on their toes throughout, and Gilliam pulls all the threads together neatly for the finale. The occasional moment of visual excess still niggles (the steampunk/trash-heap aesthetic of the future isn't my cup of tea), but on the whole this is definitely one of the director's best films.Bruce Willis stars as James Cole, a convict from the future who is sent to the past to try and discover the origins of the virus that wiped out most of the world's human population. After a violent altercation with the police of 1990, Cole is sent to an asylum where he meets patient Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), son of a wealthy scientist (played by Christopher Plummer), and quite possibly plants the seeds of mankind's destruction in the lunatic's mind. Together with his psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), Cole tries to prevent the disaster from occurring.At times, it seems as though Gilliam has only the slightest command of proceedings, and the film demands that the viewer puts in 100% concentration to avoid becoming as lost and confused as Cole himself, who becomes more and more unsure about what is reality and what isn't as the film progresses. Characters ramble, often seemingly incoherently, but what they are saying is, for the most part, intrinsic to the outcome, so pay attention (or have your finger on the rewind button). Those who make the effort will be rewarded by a film that is constantly inventive and frequently clever, and worth at least a few viewings to appreciate it to the fullest.\n",

            "Review 4: Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to. Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed. As Willis asserts \"It's already happened,\" while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself. It's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of dementia.Besides this, 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo. All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery. With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist. She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness. Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10\n",

            "Review 6: \"Twelve monkeys\"'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. \"Twelve monkeys\" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in \"Die hard\"). No matter how he tries, he's a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It's got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, \"twelve monkeys\" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.\n",

            "Review 7: Stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. The fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.Terry Gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film. He gives the movie a decadent feel throughout, showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy. His world, the world in which TWELVE MONKEYS transpires, is a place where the mad run wild, where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect, where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence, where madness looms at every corner. This is a very dark movie, but his very best, most linear (despite the plot twists which hold up under examination), and one which gets better with repeated viewings.A tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of Life On The Planet As We Have Known It leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity's fate on the Earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the Earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time, among them one James Cole (underplayed to great effect by Bruce Willis). Cole could be any person. We don't know anything about him, but in a way, that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. What we do know is that he is a man who dreams, and his dreams may have been reality: he may have already been at the scene of the Event of 1996.It's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. When taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets Jeffrey Goines (spastically played by Brad Pitt, Oscar-nominated here) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction, and later Cole believes he has seen Goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? He doesn't know. Later he meets a psychologist, Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane, and that she's seen him before. This becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that Something Terrible is coming This Way, especially when she meets him six years later: she has seen Cole before. At the same time, Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle, screaming for help, after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail (Jeffrey Goines?) has apparently escaped, not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. The questions arise: have these events happened? Are they going to happen? Who is really a part of this, or better yet -- is everyone, down to the smallest player, a part of a Greater Plot? Or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which Time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again? These questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece VERTIGO in which Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton mourns her own brief existence (\"You took no notice,\" she says, as Cole and Railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in). Snippets of dialog from VERTIGO form a foil to the dialog between Railly and Cole and later, when Cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for Railly, he comes face-to-face with her in disguise (looking almost exactly like Eva Maria Saint from NORTH BY NORTHWEST) as the swelling Bernard Herrmann score plays the emergence of Judy Barton, dressed as Madeleine Elster. It's a fascinating sequence, more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films: Madeleine Stowe plays Kathryn Railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself \"Judy Simmons\" while helping an \"insane\" man named James Cole; James Stewart plays a detective who tries to help \"insane\" Madeleine Elster who will later re-appear not once, but twice, first as brunette Judy Barton, and later, as Madeleine. Action and re-enaction, play and re-play.\n",

            "Review 8: Normally I try to avoid Sci-Fi movies as much as I can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this \"Twelve Monkeys\" I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.Even after several viewings, I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. However, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 9: I grew up on Python and have followed Terry Gilliam's subsequent directorial career for more years than I care to remember. Half his output leaves me cold, the other half dazzle me beyond belief. 'Brazil' is his movie that I would rate the highest, but I've come to think that I have unfairly underrated 'Twelve Monkeys'. I have always enjoyed it, but I've only come to realize just how good a movie it really is. Sometimes I think it is even better than 'Brazil'. It's a close pick. Unlike 'Brazil' Gilliam didn't come up with the script. He basically was initially involved as a director for hire. Thankfully the script itself (by David and Janet Peoples) is first rate. On top of that Gilliam manages to stamp his own style and approach on to the material without sliding into complete self-indulgence as he sometimes does. The budget of this movie wasn't anywhere near as large as you would imagine from the impressive results on screen. It looks superb. Gilliam coaxes  first rate performances out of Bruce Willis (quite a surprise) and Brad Pitt (not such a surprise, see also 'Johnny Suede' and 'Kalifornia'). Madeline Stowe is also very good, as is Christopher Plummer, and in a small but important role, David Morse. It's difficult to fault this movie. It is a joy to watch, and improves with each viewing. I also highly recommend Chris Marker's 'La Jetee', the short experimental film which inspired 'Twelve Monkeys'. It is also brilliant.\n",

Gilliam's flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by David and Janet Peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis at his most Steve McQueen-like -- better than McQueen, even!), a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether he's coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that's deadly to humans but harmless to animals.  Willis, the justifiably Oscar-nominated Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers.  Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting.  This one's a don't-miss!\n",

            "Review 11: A convict from the year 2035 is assigned a mission in order to win parole. He is sent back in time by a group of scientists to try and discover the source of a fatal plague that wiped out most of the human race. A plague which did not kill animals. In his travels he discovers mysterious graffiti announcing the arrival of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.Terry Gilliam has always been an interesting film director and visual stylist even when some of his movies are uneven. With 12 Monkeys he perhaps produces his most wholly satisfying work. It's a consistently compelling mystery within the framework of a time-travelling sci-fi narrative. It's a fairly complex story, so attention is demanded of the viewer. This is perhaps the chief strength of the film, however, as the labyrinthine narrative is one that benefits from multiple viewings. There are still some elements of ambiguity even at the end, so it's a film that actively encourages discussion.There's a good cast too. Bruce Willis was on a bit of a run in the mid 90's and this is one of the great films he appeared in at the height of his powers. On the other hand, it's one of the first films where Brad Pitt was allowed to display his acting chops and show that he was a lot more than just a pretty face. While in visual terms, it's as interesting as you would expect from a Gilliam movie; although not as phantasmagorical as some of his more personal fantasy features. In 12 Monkeys he was a director for hire but it's not immediately obvious. Perhaps the distance this gave him actually helped instill some discipline that made the whole more cohesive on the whole. Whatever the case, this is an excellent sci-fi film with a compelling central mystery.\n",

            "Review 12: With 'Twelve Monkeys' you need to pay attention, but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with time traveling. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories.The movie constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and \"they\" send someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. You could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.'Twelve Monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. You are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. May be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me.\n",

            "Review 13: It is unfortunate that all big budget films cannot be as good as 12 MONKEYS. But alas is that not what makes these once in a while films so special? Obviously director Gilliam is a rare talent, a treasure. But even for him 12 Monkeys outshines nearly everything else he's ever done. (And that says a lot. Brazil after all is another incredible film.) But this movie has two things going for it that ale it rise to the very top of the top. #1 it features a stellar cast who all equally deliver fantastic performances. This is Bruce Willis at his peak -- before he sold out and went all Die Hard, when e still cared about being taken seriously as an actor. Same with Brad Pitt. Many attribute this film as the first time Pitt showed the world that he truly was an actor and not just another pretty face. (He further proved that point in Fight Club and many others through the years -- Money Ball, Tree of Life, et al.) and then there's Madeline Stowe. Besides the stellar acting though 12 Monkeys accomplished something even more important: it gave us the opportunity for future films such as Memento and Inception. 12 Monkeys not only featured a non-linear approach to time travel, it did so erratically boldly dynamically and unapologetically so, allowing future filmmakers, like the aforementioned referenced Nolan brothers, to feel safe stepping even further out on those limbs. 12 Monkeys opened that door and so many others. This is a film you can see over and over and still see something new in it AND be moved by. A classic by all standards.\n",

            "Review 14: I had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago, and outside the theater I was confronted by a camera crew from a local TV station looking for comments on the film. At the time, the only words that escaped my mouth were \"Awesome. Just awesome.\" I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that, but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so.The story is intriguing and thought provoking, and the acting is first rate from all the principals. This film was the first one that Terry Gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. Back with Universal after his long, arduous battle with them over \"Brazil\", Terry had achieved what he wanted most; the \"final cut\". Terry is a master craftsman, and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately, limitations still exist in such arrangements.The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing, although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. It contains among other things, a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called \"The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys\". It tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking, including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly, striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success.\n",

            "Review 15: Obviously, a lot of people adore \"Twelve Monkeys\", as it's currently #180 on IMDb--placing it among the very best films ever made. While I recognize that it is an amazingly unusual plot (done before in the short French film \"La Jetée\"), it just isn't the sort of film that appeals to me--though I generally do like fantasy and sci-fi films. I guess the film's weirdness and very slow pace just didn't appeal to me--perhaps you'll love it.Bruce Willis plays a criminal from the future who has been sent back in time to try to prevent a HUGE apocalyptic event in which most of the people on Earth will be wiped out in 1996. Now I NEVER understood why they put the entire future of mankind on a criminal nor did I understand why they just didn't send dozens or thousands back in time to make 100% sure the plague would not occur. Regardless, he arrives too early--back in 1990. And, unfortunately, he's seen as a crazy man and is sent to an asylum. There, he meets a goofy psychiatrist (are there any other type in films?!) and a real crazy guy (Brad Pitt). How will these three folks work together to either cause or prevent devastation? See this film if you want to know.Aside from seeing Frank Gorshin in a very unusual role as the man running the asylum, not a lot appealed to me about this one. I didn't dislike the film--I just never felt all that interested. Part of this might be because I never liked \"La Jetée\"--part of it might be because Madeline Stowe's character seemed really hard to believe (sort of like Ingrid Bergman and her incredibly gullible character in \"Spellbound\"--another goofy female psychiatrist with no personal boundaries and a tenuous hold on reality). All I know is that I wanted to like this movie but didn't. However, I did respect that it tried to be different and quite complex. Worth a look, though I can't figure out exactly what everyone loves about this one.\n",

            "Review 16: There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled \"Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts\". It ended with a simple message saying: \"please don't do any of the above in my movie\".There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.Whatever the truth of the rumour above, Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I watched it again, I realised that it hadn't really aged. I had changed, of course. And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. A first rate film. 8/10.\n",

            "Review 17: Usually, we expect Bruce Willis to only act in the stupidest kinds of movies, but he does a different kind of role here in \"Twelve Monkeys\". Sometime in the future, a virus has wiped out much of the human population. There are some convicts locked up in a facility, including James Cole (Bruce Willis). Cole is hired to go back in time to find the cause of the virus. But several unexpected things happen in the course of his adventure back in time. Things which may or may not bring him closer to the truth than he realizes.Terry Gilliam, always one for the bizarre, created something really interesting here. More than simply a \"disease story\", \"Twelve Monkeys\" looks at the virus from the future, giving one a tingly feeling. Good support from Madeleine Stowe as Kathryn Railly, trying to help Cole find out what caused the virus, and Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines, who may or may not be associated with the virus. Not like any movie that you've ever seen.\n",

            "Review 18: I don't know why his name is not under credits, but Pitt has done one of the best acts ever, of his career. No wonder he was nominated an Oscar for this. For all his amazing looks, he puts too much hard work in his roles. I never thought if that crazy guy role for a slim, good looking, stubbled stud will ever work. But he proved these amazing guys too can be crazy, that too beautifully.Bruce was good as usual, may be too much drooling in his role and for his psychiatrist. Even for that personality he easily managed to overpower those two guys in the theater (kinda Die Hard thing). That scene was funny as hell.Time travels, I think, if are that frequent, can never be right on the money. Ending up in the trenches as result is never a good idea. Can't they transport the person with his clothes on. I mean I will never wish to be teleported to some place naked, at-least factor in the weather for God's sake.We have witnessed Corona recently and 2035 is a bit far away. Doesn't portend well for the human race.Overall a good watch #TwelveMonkeys1995 - 8/10.\n",

            "Review 19: In 2027 James Cole is a prisoner living beneath the streets of Philadelphia with some of the very few survivors of a virus which wiped out most of humankind back in 1996. Somehow these people living under the streets have invented time travel. OK then. The scientists in charge send Cole back to 1996 to collect information on the virus in order to develop a cure. Why, if you have time travel capabilities, the focus is on finding a cure for the few people alive in 2027 rather than stopping the virus from wiping out the species in the first place is not particularly clear. Anyhow Cole's mission gets off to a bad start when he ends up in 1990 rather than 1996 and immediately finds himself placed in a mental institution. This is all very weird. It's about to get much weirder.Cole ends up jumping back and forth in time, quite befuddled by the whole experience. Anyone watching this film will also feel that sense of befuddlement. It's certainly an intriguing story but one which director Terry Gilliam never really got a firm grasp on. The film ends up being a bit of a disjointed mess. You're drawn into the story but ultimately end up lost in this movie's complex maze. Bruce Willis turns in a solid performance as Cole. He's solid and reliable, giving this film which threatens to veer out of control some desperately needed grounding. Brad Pitt is the other big star. He plays Jeffrey Goines who is one of the craziest crazies in the institution. Pitt plays the part with wild-eyed manic enthusiasm. The effect is quite jarring. Yes, Jeffrey is supposed to be crazy but this is some serious overacting on Pitt's part. Madeleine Stowe plays the female lead, Kathryn Railly, Cole's doctor at the institution. Cole pops in and out of her life. Initially she thinks he's nuts but as she processes new information she may have to re-evaluate that position. Unfortunately the chemistry between Willis and Stowe is lacking, the relationship between their characters falls rather flat. And as their relationship becomes more important in the story that becomes a big problem for the movie.Ultimately 12 Monkeys is a rather frustrating film. It has an intriguing premise but the story does not play itself out in a very satisfying way. Things get muddled pretty quickly and the story twists itself into some confusing knots. The film tries to spring some surprises but telegraphs some of its twists way too soon, which is part of the reason the ending is not nearly as powerful as Gilliam would hope. Meanwhile Gilliam's assortment of visual tricks throughout serve no purpose other than to distract and annoy. Stowe's performance lacks energy, Pitt's has too much energy. Christopher Plummer is underused. Willis does a fine job but too much of what surrounds him disappoints. For all the jumping back and forth in time the film is rather slowly paced. The story may interest you but there really is not much in the way of entertainment. You would imagine a story such as this would be full of exciting moments but excitement is in very short supply. 12 Monkeys held great promise but in the end that promise is not fulfilled.\n",

            "Review 20: I know \"12 Monkeys\" gets its respects in being a highly respectable science fiction motion picture, but it deserves a whole lot more then just that. I believe this is one of the greatest Sci-Fi flicks ever created. It's imaginative, visionary, and masterfully conceptualized; all imperative elements in the orchestration of profound science fiction. Brad Pitt delivered one of the most entertaining and fun performances I've ever witnessed as a crazed looney bird who's the son of a eminent virologist, and to a less profound degree in the art of acting, Bruce Willis displayed one of his greater performances as well. 12 monkeys hits on all cylinders and makes it one of the great Terry Gilliam's most profound achievements.\n",

            "Review 21: Twelve Monkeys is the kind of movie that gets much better with time. With each subsequent viewing, you start appreciating something new, understanding the story a little bit more, and linking new plots elements. I'm saying this because the settings and scenes are rather crude and unpleasant to assimilate, even though the final product is incredible.The good. Tight logical story. Engrossing scenario that gets better with time. Excellent acting. Interesting treatment of a fairly common theme. Great details. Nice conception of the future.The actors. Bruce Willis plays the dislocated and slightly unhinged hero to perfection. Great acting. Madeleine Stowe is just right as the unwilling but open-minded participant. Brad Pitt's mad interpretation is pure genius and an obvious precursor of his role in Fight Club (review still to come).The bad. The whole flick will not please everybody for its gruesome take, the slow development, and the logical conclusion, which I must admit is as it should be. It is morally disappointing and a slightly simple considering the circumvolutions of the story itself.The ugly. Nothing ugly there, but the rawness of it all.The result. Watch it. Let a year go by.

            "Review 22: This movie opens with \"... 5 Billion People Will Die From A Deadly Virus in 1997 ... The Survivors Will Abandon The Surface of The Planet ... Once Again The Animals Will Rule The World ...\" - Excerpts from Interview with clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, April 12, 1990 Baltimore County Hospital.In a dystopic near-future, criminal James Cole (Bruce Willis) is forced to volunteer to go up to the surface and collect samples. He is given the opportunity to reduce his 25 to life sentence by time-traveling to 1996 and gather information on the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Back in 1990 Baltimore, county psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is brought in to examine James Cole after a fight with 2 cops. He is locked up in the county sanatorium where he meets manic babbling Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). He pleads to make a telephone call but the time hasn't come yet. He's suppose to be in 1996. Meanwhile he keeps having flashbacks of an incident as a kid. The future pulls him back but he's thrown back into the wrong time period again. When he finally arrives in the right time, he kidnaps Kathryn Railly.This is chalk full of Terry Gilliam goodness originality. I love the craziness. I love his style. This is the closest to portraying madness coherently on the big screen. Bruce Willis inhabits the regular guy under stress and then there is the wild madness coming from Brad Pitt. Madeleine Stowe is also terrific. I love the various settings. I love the crazy future. I love the decaying present. I love the asylum. I love it all.\n",

            "Review 23: Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  I especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.The story itself is engaging: one man, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. With such a complex movie, it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess, but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. It marked me a lot: I remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines  almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.There are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. The twist is brilliant, but I prefer this ending for emotional impact. Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr. Railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense, the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.The twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain. Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. It's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.\n",

            "Review 24: In 2003,I was one night channel surfing,and on one of the channels (the UK Sci-Fi channel)I noticed the channel was showing a short intro,about the first showing on the channel of a film called 12 Monkeys.Intrigued massively,due to how muchthe documentary discussed, what seemed to be the many interesting plot threads that feature in the film.Sadly,my brothers were desperate to watch one of their videos at the time,so I did not get a chance to watch the film.A year later...I was downstairs with my dad at 1am,and we were trying to find any films that was on,that looked interesting.After seeing that the movie channels were not showing anything,we decided that we would instead watch some comedy shows on the UK Gold channel.When we went on the channel,we found out that instead of showing comedies that night, the channel was showing 12 Monkeys!.Although the film was at the half-way point,from the very first scene that I saw,where a man-was holding a woman hostage in her own car and telling her to drive to a state that is over 100 miles away.I was gripped from that very moment.The film grabbed my attention by the throat,in a way that hardly anything I had seen,or read before had.Before viewing the film,almost all of the stories that I had enjoy,had been ones with very simple a- to- b narratives.But in the final hour of this film,I was completely astonished at how amazing well the film was able to hold very complex plot threads,in an unforgettable way.From the moment that the end credits appeared,I knew that I had seen a true modern classic that I would never forget.The plot-1997:A virus (that is spread in the air) gets realised that kills 99% of the human race,which causes all of the survivors to go deep underground,as all of the animals start to regain there foothold,in being the dominant species.2035:After having failed to figure out what caused the spread of the virus,a group of scientist decide to build a time machine,so that they can send a human to late 1996 to gather information about how the virus got released,so that they can try to start rebuilding humanity.The selection process to choose a traveller (and to make sure that it is someone that they don't urgently need in the present)is to randomly select a prisoners number.The prisoner selected is James Cole,a man who has been put in prison,due to his violent disorder in the past (although none of the scientist know that for his whole life James has been having the same dream/nightmare of something that has left his subconscious permanently damaged.)With having no choice at all,Cole is told that he is going to be sent to late 1996,to find out about the virus,and to find out about a group named The Army of the 12 Monkeys.As James goes into the machine,he is told that because of how advance the machine is,he will defiantly arrive in 1996.When he wakes up,Cole realises that he is in 199...1990:As Cole awakes,he discoverers that he is being held in a police cell,for allegedly beating up a cop.The police get a psychiatrist (Dr.Kathryn Raily) to speak to him,due to Cole talking about lots of \"crazy stuff\".With James telling Kathryn that five billion people are going to die in seven years,she decides that the best place for Cole to go,is to a mental hospital.At the hospital,Cole meets Jeffery Goines- a fellow patient in the hospital,who tries to help Cole escape.Later, Goines latches on to something that James says to him in a conversation about animal-testing,(which,as Cole gets pulled back to 2035,to (hopefully) be sent again to late 96) has affected Jeffery ,in ways that Cole cant even dream of...View on the film:Whilst Pitt and Willis are praised for there excellent performances,I've always felt that Madeleine Stowe has always been over looked,for her strong performance as Raily.As Kathryn,Stowe does very well at expressing views that most audience members would have in the same situations.Stowe also performs the switch that the character experiences in the film,(where Raily starts at being very doubtful about what Cole is saying,to being the one that becomes more hungry to discover the truth about the virus than James is)extremely well,by making the progression of Railys attitude,feel very natural.Whilst it seems that most people are now very accepting about Pitt doing roles of people who are a bit \"loose\",here he gives a stunning performance as Jeffery,with the scenes of him and Cole in the mental ward-which most actors would have performed with Goines being a ranting loony nutter,being impressively performed by Pitt as a man who is defiantly mentally disturbed,yet someone who is also very smart,who really wants to succeed with his plans.Although he will mainly be remembered for his fun action films,Willis is truly astonishing as Cole,giving a brilliant,strong,mature performance,with Willis also giving Cole a surprising amount of humanity,as the time travailing starts to scramble his brain.Whilst the brilliant cast are always given attention,I feel that the star of the film is the truly breathtaking screenplay by Janet and David Peoples,which is able to keep the amazing complex plot going,with out ever letting it fall apart,that uses threads in the story that are set up right at the very beginning ,and instead of being hinted at too strongly,they are instead used intelligently as an underlying issue through out the film,until the unforgettable ending,when they are brilliantly revealed.Even though though the main love story,does have a few nods to Hitchcock's \"dream\" classic Vertigo,12 Monkeys is still its own thing,with it being wisely used,to let Cole show his desire.Final view on the film: A mind-blowing perfect film.\n",

            "Review 25: Carrying in each frame the chaotic and striking visual style of its director, \"Twelve Monkeys\" is an interesting science fiction, which also has inspired performances by its cast and a narrative that is at the same time complex and fascinating to conquer the viewer. Featuring a depressing environment in the future and another about to collapse in the past, Terry Gilliam's feature looks more like a nightmare, holding the viewer's attention not only for its look, but also for the clever way that its great premise is developed. Exploring time travel and temporal paradoxes, you are abducted into a confusing plot full of twists and turns. The most fascinating thing about this fantastic script is that, even with a huge knot in the head, it manages to close in a solid and at the same time questioning conclusion. At the end of the film, we come to an issue (no, I'll give spoilers here), something completely acceptable, and that doesn't leave us with the feeling of having been tricked by a script that didn't know how to close. Quite the contrary, the entire text was developed exactly to its conclusion.Inspired by Chris Marker's film \"La Jetée\", David and Janet Peoples' intricate screenplay begins in 2035, when James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to the past to gather information about a lethal virus that has decimated human beings. In 1996, killing an estimated five billion people. However, due to a mistake by the scientists, James returns to 1990 and ends up in a mental institution, where he meets the psychiatrist Kathryn (Madeleine Stowe) and the young Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), son of Dr. Goines (Christopher Plummer) is likely responsible for the birth of the group known as the \"army of Twelve Monkeys\", which theoretically would have spread the lethal virus around the world.Right in its first minutes, \"Twelve Monkeys\" demonstrates its dreamlike facet through the mysterious dream of its protagonist in an airport that, in fact, seems more like a tormenting and recurrent nightmare, appearing in several moments to terrify him. Then, James appears in a rather uncomfortable cell, talking to another prisoner in the underground world (where the few survivors of the virus try to survive) moments before being summoned for a mysterious mission. In this way, the director seeks to facilitate the spectator's identification with his protagonist, who appears vulnerable, in precarious conditions and about to be sent on an uncertain mission. With the help of editor Mick Audsley, Gilliam adds dynamism to the narrative, keeping it always intriguing precisely because he conducts it from the perspective of James, thus placing us in the same position as the protagonist, also succeeding in inserting time travel in an organic way. - with the exception of the first sharp jump from the present to 1990 in Baltimore.Creating a dirty and abandoned world in the present and an unattractive one in the past, the director reflects on screen his protagonist's mental confusion. The chaotic place where James meets the scientists, for example, helps to create the troubled and anarchic atmosphere intended by the director. By the way, the scenes that take place in the present have such an exaggerated caricature tone that, sometimes, they end up making the audience laugh - which serves as comic relief in a narrative that demands a lot of attention. Already in the past, the peeling walls of the asylum make the environment quite realistic and help to illustrate the protagonist's disgust in that place. And if William Ladd Skinner's art direction is essential in this process, the interesting costumes by Julie Weiss not only reinforce this look but also distinguish each era well, such as the Second World War and the 90s.The film's script, written by David Webb and Janet Peoples, manages to create an intriguing dubious perception in the viewer, who at a given moment in the work wonders if the character was hallucinating or if all that had really happened. For those who know La Jetée, this perception may be just a shadow or not even exist, but it is clear to identify the game of realities on the screen, questioning and playing with memory and even with History that can come literally (at this point, more subtly) or aesthetically (very strongly), with very special references to the films \"Monkey Business\" (1931), \"Vertigo\" (1958), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Escape from New York (1981), cinematographic plurality which shows Terry Gilliam's predilection for great excesses and also his ability to work with them organically.Even though the beginning of the film has a slower pace than it should and the first trip is abrupt and uninteresting, the audience quickly forgets about these flaws and focuses on the journey of Cole, who tries to fulfill a complex mission while having the \"misfortune\" of falling in love with a woman from his past, which will lead to more aggressive surveillance by the scientists who sent him and seal his fate at the airport. Gilliam's direction is realistic, even when the production design reaches baroque peaks in the mixture of technologies and inventions throughout the 2035 scenario, which bears many similarities with the environment of \"Brazil\" and \"The Zero Theorem\", similarities that ended up making some cinephiles consider the works part of a trilogy, although this has not been stated or thought by Gilliam. The public is thrown into two worlds that believe themselves, in some way, victorious, but are, each in their own way, decadent and share the same behavioral deviations, manipulation structures maintained by those who hold any kind of power (scientific, war , financial, etc.) and the struggle of some individuals to free themselves from the yoke of this manipulation and control, almost literally reintroducing to us the struggle of the characters in They Live, by John Carpenter: buy, watch TV, obey.In the cast we have the always charismatic, Bruce Willis conquering the viewer with his vulnerable James Cole, taking the audience with him on that journey and convincing even when he begins to question his own sanity - special emphasis on two scenes, one in a hospital bed in front of the scientists and another in a hotel room with Kathryn. Exhibiting the anguish of someone who feels out of place and confused and the determination of someone who has a mission to accomplish, Willis creates a captivating and very human character. Brad Pitt, on the other hand, is sensational as the crazy Jeffrey Goines, with his tics, fast speech, the oscillation in the tone of voice and the constant movement in the eyes, which very well characterize a character that is simultaneously dangerous and fascinating. Together, they are responsible for the best moments of \"Twelve Monkeys\". However, there are other interesting moments, especially when they involve Madeleine Stowe's Kathryn, which conveys well the distress and confusion in the character's mind in the face of James and her statements. And we cannot fail to mention Christopher Plummer, who efficiently embodies Jeffrey's famous father, even though he appears rarely on the scene.At a certain point in the plot, the viewer starts to share James' doubt and asks if all that doesn't really exist only in the protagonist's mind. But the complete turnaround happens when a boy is found in the barn (as he had said it would happen) and, added to a photograph of the first world war and the bullet removed from his leg, proves to Kathryn and the viewer that James was speaking the truth. And then the reference to the classic \"A Falling Body\" appears in Kathryn's disguise, in the images of Hitchcock's film inside a movie theater and even in the soundtrack, thematically tying the narrative and opening up the film's message: we will never be able to change the past. This message is confirmed in the emblematic final scene, where the \"dream\" is repeated. Kathryn's gaze at young James, accompanied by a slight smile, turns this painful scene into a beautiful moment, illustrating the moment in which she realizes that James would live forever in this cycle.Mick Audsley's montage is also efficient and interesting rhymes are created: Cole being scared by a bear in the future to, later in the present, being scared by a stuffed bear are examples of this. And Gilliam, with Roger Pratt's photography, still creates visual anecdotes, such as when the protagonist tries to hide from the police by turning to a shop window only to realize he is on the same television, as it is one of those stores with TVs and cameras turned to the street. The incidental soundtrack is excellent and the imposing tango \"Suite Punta Del Este\" composed by Ástor Piazzolla, brings an unforgettable tone to the plot and has become his trademark, as well as the tracks What a Wonderful World, Blueberry Hill and Sleep Walk, that manage to illustrate the emotional charge of the various journeys throughout the film.Time travel is nothing new in fiction, non-linear scripts too. Apocalyptic future even less. Still, \"Twelve Monkeys\" has an air of innovation. It adds to our lives. It has drama, humor, suspense, philosophy, romance, all wrapped up in a genius idea from a Frenchman who the American knew how to reconstruct with mastery. Interesting from a visual and technical point of view and with a thought-provoking plot, \"Twelve Monkeys\" is one of those films worth discussing in the midst of the current pandemic. Since it is a temporal paradox, if it depends on your characters and history, there is nothing we can do. Regardless of our actions, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.\n",

            "Review 1: When this came out -- years ago, I thought, \"Wow, this is pretty amazing\" and since then movie audiences have been amazed at a number of camera tricks, computer-enhanced people, animals, monsters, and who knows what....so this kind of story with fun special effects is no longer is unique.However, it's so charming, so nice a story that it should hold up as solid entertainment for a long, long time. It has proved to be anything but a flash-in-the-pan. This movie will endure. It's also a beautiful film on DVD with brilliant colors and some very rich visuals. Filmed in rural Australia, the scenery is magnificent and so is the house that is featured in the film. It looks like some old-fashioned gingerbread house. The animals are entertaining, talking to one another like humans but not looking hokey in the process. In other words, the dubbing is well done.The main character, \"Babe,\" the little pig, is the nicest, most innocent \"character\" you could ever hope to find. Listening to him talk is heart-warming most of the time and sometimes it's heart-breaking. The best comic relief is provided by the goose who wants to be a rooster. That may sound like it's geared toward little kids, but it isn't. I haven't found an adult friend yet who didn't like this film.It also was good to see James Cromwell play a nice guy, too. Most other times he seems to play profane and corrupt cops or government officials. Here, he's just a nice old farmer who blends in perfectly with the surroundings. His wife is a bit annoying, but not too bad.This is a wonderful, sweet-hearted comedy-drama with a nice ending, too, guaranteed to leave you with a smile or a tear, or both. This is one of the best \"family\" movies of all time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 2: Remember the times when a parent or a grandparent would read to a child in bed, so that the child can visualize the story and comfortably sink into his/her dreamworld? Well, 'Babe' feels like such a story. It is a heartwarming tale about a Pig (called Babe by her 'Mom') and her friends at the farm. Chris Noonan executes it in such a wonderful way. The film is broken into chapters (just like in a book) and the lovable talking animals appear like very real and humanistic characters. the lip-syncing is impeccable. Also, I liked that the film doesn't completely refrain from reality as it does show that pigs are killed for meat or that puppies are given away or sold to others. It stays honest. The voice-acting is very well done. Christine Cavanaugh's childlike voice remarkably fits Babe. Miriam Margolyes, Danny Mann, Hugo Weaving and Miriam Flynn are all pleasing. James Cromwell is wonderfully restrained. The setting is a make-belief story-book farm. I found myself wondering, 'Is this an English farm?' and at the same time being confused that the people were speaking with an American accent but there's really no need to pick on that because it simply doesn't matter. Just enjoy the beautiful farm and the lovely characters. 'Babe' is one of the finest family films. Kids will surely love it. Heck, even I loved it when I saw it during my late teens...and I still love it as an adult.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 3: I think genre preferences go out of the window when a film like 'Babe' comes along. It's easy to see why this film is so universally popular, the story is delightful and the main characters so likable and endearing. The idea of a having a film centre on a cute pig may have raised a few eyebrows at first, but after only a few minutes any doubts anyone had will have gone.There isn't much I can write about this film other than saying how much I enjoy it every time I see it (and that's a good few times now). I never get tired of it and it's probably one of my go-to films when I'm in the mood for a family film. I'm yet to meet anyone who doesn't like 'Babe', I'm sure there are people out there who don't like it and I'd be interested to hear their reasons, but you'd be hard pushed to find a family film as universally popular as this one.\n",

            "Review 4: Babe is separated from his family and becomes friends with some of the animals on his new farm.  He learns that each animal has a role to play and that both he and Ferdinand the duck are fated to be lunch!  Both take new roles to escape their fate and Babe tries to become a sheepdog.  As Farmer Hoggett begins to notice the unusual way Babe can work with the sheep he begins to groom him for that role  much to the worry of his wife and the other farm animals.Written by the guy who wrote the Mad Max films  that's what kills me.  I know it's adapted but how can the Mad Max writer manage to deliver such a sweet film that is unassuming and comic and heart warming.  The plot is great as it is adapted from `The Sheeppig' but Miller's script adds so many comic touches that it's funny throughout.  The characters are all well written so that we care about them and get easily drawn in.It's directed well and again feels fresh and different  whether it's the chapter set up or the use of the narrator or the way that the singing mice make the links it all works well.  Because it is gentle and unassuming I found myself involved in it so easily and the themes of finding your own path and friendship are not rammed down your throat but just sit there if you want to get them.  I've seen this several times and the silent, wonderful climax to the sheepdog trials makes me choke everytime (even if it is predictable).All the voices are good and the use of animals is faultless.  The use of animatronics is a little ropey at times but the sense of goodwill the film gave me extended to overlooking these minor complaints.  James Cromwell is just superb as the human face in this drama  everytime I see him now I can only hear him say `that'll do pig'.  Babe is a great hero and you feel for him from the start to the end  when he gives a little satisfied sigh it's difficult not to feel warm inside.Overall this is one of the best children's films I've seen  it's light and unassuming and not a classic but it is comic, gentle and ultimately heart warming  what more do you want?\n",

            "Review 5: Babe is the runt of the litter who was born in a factory farm. He gets picked as the worthless prize in a country fair. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) who doesn't keep pigs, wins him in a guess the weight contest. Babe ends up being raised by the sheep dog mother Fly. He befriends the various animals. With the help of Ferdinand the Duck, he gets into trouble and slowly learns the way of the farm. He is doomed to be Christmas dinner for Esme Hoggett but Farmer Hoggett convinces her to save his life. Then Farmer Hoggett notices something strange about the pig.There is a great sense of wonderment and joy in this movie. It plays like one of those kids books and it's so terrific for it. Roscoe Lee Browne's narration is the perfect tone. It doesn't use any modern references or knowing sarcasm. It is a sincere old fashion melodrama and part modern feel good charmer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 6: This is a family film in the classic sense of the word, and it'd be hard to find a more charming and heartfelt tale. Ideally for children, but it can be enjoyed by adults too. It is a fantasy world where animals speak just like humans do.....albeit not in Australian accents, which is where the film is meant to be set.The hero of this tale is a young pig named Babe, who is transfered from the pig pen, to the village fête, to the hands of Farmer Hoggett who wins the little fellow in a prize raffle(James Cromwell). It is on the farm he meets the locals, and is taken under the wing by a kind sheepdog named Fly, who has been characterised as the warm and motherly type. Not so warm is Rex (voiced by Hugo Weaving of Agent Smith fame), her growling no nonsense other half, who believes pigs do not belong with sheepdogs.Babe is portrayed as the personification of innocence, and his gleeful and inquisitive nature brings him into contact with a host of farmyard animals. Not too sure why they felt he needed a furry little toupee between his ears, but each to his own. As Babe gets closer to Fly and the sheepdog role, he even begins to assume this role, much to Rex's dismay. But Babe has an awful lot of ambition for a little animal, and his heart is set on being a \"sheep-pig\".There are moments of sadness in this film, such as loss and death, but it is mainly sweet natured and enchanting. It is one of the few Universal rated films I enjoy watching, and that is saying something for me!\n",

            "Review 7: All too often, children's movies are simply insipid for adults who get suckered taking the kids. The kids are happy but the parents are continually checking their watches to see when the film ends! BABE is a rare family film in that it has appeal to all ages. I know when I took my then five year-old to come see it, we both enjoyed it and now 14 years later, we still adore this film as much as ever.There have already been a ton of reviews for this film and trivia on IMDb explains the complicated process by which the film was made, so I really don't want to get into this. Just suffice to say that by using very realistic puppets from the Henson Workshop and lots of live creatures, they managed to convincingly tell a story where the audience is pulled into it--and actually can accept that the animals talk and do other extraordinary things.What I love about the film is its tremendous sense of style. Not only does it have a wonderful idea, but the combination of great music, amazing cinematography, storybook farms that look like David Winter cottages, the best voice actors you can imagine and those wonderful mice all work together to make a film that is a truly unique viewing experience.Overall, what's not to like? I know some have actually seen this as a PETA or vegetarian plot, but I cannot imagine anyone not loving this film. And, if anyone you know doesn't like it, you should get some new friends! By the way, as excited and in love with this film as I was and am, I feel almost 180 degrees different about the abomination that was the sequel, BABE: PIG IN THE CITY. Lost is all the charm and grace that made BABE one of the best family films in history. In its place is a cruel and dark film with nothing at all to recommend it. How could they have missed the boat so badly with the sequel?\n",

            "Review 8: My god, a 6.7 average score and nominated for 7(SEVEN) oscars?? It has been a very long time since I've seen this movie but it's great. Very original and wonderfully done.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 9: \"Babe\" is one of my favorite movies.A lot of people laugh at me when I say that. But I know that this film is one of the best ones ever made. It's simple, beautiful, positive and original.The story is about a farm pig who wants to become a sheep dog. Pretty strange considering a pig's place is in people's plates. But Babe has something the sheep dogs don't have: gallantry. His kindness, determination and good intentions will make him a truly unique individual, one that stands out from his peers, proving that no matter who you are, you can make a difference.I love the way the story is made. It is cut into chapters with a bit of narration, giving us the warm \"grandfather story\" or \"old school\" feeling. It's a very comfortable ambiance, and every animal brings its personality into making an awesome story.Now I am sure you've all seen talking animal movies before, with voice-overs. Babe took it one step further with the animals' lips being in sync with their lines! Talk about realism! The sets are very friendly to the eyes and contribute into making this movie a classic.Babe is one great movie for everyone to see, it's magical and enchanting!The Master T Score: ***** out of 5 Stars\n",

            "Review 10: I was privileged to see this in the cinema in Melbourne years ago when it first came out and the buzz was just starting. A young-ish, single man at the time, I was dragged along oozing skepticism - but came out loving it unreservedly. I just watched it again with my two kids, aged seven and five, and watched them lap up the magic. It was wonderful to re-visit the film through their eyes. When The Boss takes the shotgun to the barn thinking Babe has savaged the sheep, they were genuinely fearful. They hated the laughter of the crowd at the sheepdog trials when Fogget appears with a pig. They cried when that derisive laughter turns to cheers (though not as much as me...).There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love Babe. And the lost. Stay away from the latter.\n",

            "Review 11: I was dragged to this film by my girlfriend (now wife) when it first came out in fall of 1995. I had zero interest in what seemed to me nothing more than a kids movie. I recall sitting in the theater before the movie commenced, looking at my watch and estimating the time it would end, when my life could begin again after this rude 90 minute interruption.Then the film began. The moment Babe said a tearful goodbye to his mother as she was being led off to the slaughter house (\"Pig Paradise\", the narrator says), I was hooked. What stood out to me was not the tearful \"Goodbye Mom\", but the fact that after we see Babe's mom loaded into the truck, the camera goes back to Babe, siting in the corner of his industrial pen, sobbing profusely. This moment, maybe 90 seconds into the movie, is filmed so well, so perfect, that instead of coming off as melodramatic, it is heartrending. I know that word is used often to describe this film, but I do not know how else to describe it. This is one of many \"heartrending\" moments in this beautiful film.This is by far the best childrens film I have ever seen, but it really is a mistake to even call it a childrens film. It is simply a great film. A film that shows how wondrous things can happen as a result of common decency; how any individual can triumph if they believe in themselves; how vital is the help of family and friends in life's arduous journey.This a film not to be missed. It should have beaten Braveheart.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 12: This is a feel-good animal film based on the children's novel, Babe, a story about Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) winning a runty piglet named Babe at the local fair. The pig befriends the other animals on Mr. Hoggett's farm and learns and takes on the job of sheep-herding.Though a children's story, this film can be enjoyed by adults as well, as it is heartfelt and charming that is perfect for the entire family. It brings a message of friendship, courage and teamwork and the lessons of growing up. The special effects team did a great job in making the real life animals talk, so you have to suspend reality for several minutes and imagine a world where animals can interact with each other like humans can.This film reminds me of Charlotte's Web, where the pig of that film has an innocent personality whose inquisitive nature eventually brought the farm animals closer, much like the characters in this film. There are also sad moments in the film (which can, I suppose, teaches children how complicated life can be), but much of the film is filled with innocence, joy and zany characters (both human and animals).I did, however, found that some of the plot points to be a tad slow and not as adventurous as some other animal movies like Charlotte's Web, but overall, the film is a real treat for the entire family.Grade B\n",

            "Review 13: I was one of the biggest detractors of this film when I initially found out it was nominated for an academy award back in 1995.  A talking pig?  You gotta be kiddin' me!  Then, months after Braveheart walked with the award, I finally saw the infamous \"Babe.\"  Wow!  Was I ever wrong.  This movie not only deserved the nomination, but was a close, close second out of the five nominees in my book (Braveheart rightfully won, but I would have had no trouble had Babe won).  I love this film because it has a sweet lining, yet tells a deep story about resolve, goodness, and the struggles of life in a very large sense.  It makes you think, but more importantly, it makes you WANT to think about how all our lives are interconnected and what can be done by each seemingly insignificant individual to make the world a better place.  That's saying a lot, when a guy who loves stuff like True Romance digs on a piggy movie.  If you haven't seen this, buy it immediately.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 14: Babe is such a charming and enchanting film, that even the fussiest adult can't help finding it easy to like. Babe himself, voiced by Christine Cavanaugh(Darkwing Duck and Dexter's Laboratory) is an adorable character, and one scene in particular when his mother is taken away is a genuine tearjerker. The other animals are also just as engaging, including Ferdinand, and are well voiced by the likes of Miriam Margoyles and Hugo Weaving. The human characters were very warm and likable, and James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski were both wonderful. The film looks lovely, there is a nice story and the music is just superb, with Saint Saens' Organ Symphony and Delibes' Pizzicato. And I loved the singing mice, they were really sweet and funny. All in all, a true classic. 10/10 Bethnay Cox\n",

            "Review 15: An extremely quirky film that you won't mind watching with the kids. Not full of sappy platitudes, this strange little tale of a pig that wants to be a sheep dog is extremely effective in it's message without hitting you in the head with it. No doubt because it wasn't made in Hollywood... we Americans have never been good at telling children's stories without being condescending and heavy-handed with the moral message.The story takes place in some fairy tale amalgam of all the rural cultures of the English-speaking world - Sometimes it seems like England, other times Kansas, Australia, New Zealand, it's really never anywhere particular. The acting is superb, the animatronics are unrecognizable as such, and James Cromwell is superb as the taciturn farmer willing to give the little pig a chance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 16: I recall first watching this movie in August 1995(I've seen it again no fewer than twice since) with minimal expectations,figuring it was at least better than the poorly planned Gordy,which was released earlier that year(if I recall correctly),and wondering if they could pull off the \"talking pig\" film for kids. What I found simply blew me away.The simple story of a piglet(voiced by Christine CAvanaugh) who is adopted by eccentric and kindly FArmer Hogget(JAmes Cromwell,kick-starts his career here and deservedly so),and slowly but surely earns his destiny as something more than being merely food by becoming a herding or \"sheep pig\". He becomes this through the gentle guidance of Fly,the lady sheepdog(voiced by Miriam MArgoyles) who becomes the surrogate mom for the initially lost pig.Despite the reluctance of the confused male,alpha sheepdog(voiced by Hugo Weaving,well before become a celebrated mythic character actor in future films) and the skepticism of practically everyone on the farm,Babe goes about this unusual endeavor with positive results,to the amazement of--among others--Hogget's wife(Magda Szubrski,who would get much more work in the sequel).With additional voicing by(among others) Danny MAnn(as the loopy Ferdinand the Duck,who comes to believe BAbe is his \"lucky pig\"),Russi Taylor(as the ostensible villain,Duchess,the spoiled house cat)and the narration of Roscoe Lee Browne,for whom in my opinion makes the difference between this being a thoughtful,intelligent movie for all ages and merely something elementary,this movie--a treatment of a Dick KIng-Smith novel and a George Miller screenplay--is a true treat. Director Chris Noonan is able to capture that certain something that makes this neither treacly nor banal. The choice of blending classical music with old doo-wop standards(sung by the field mice!)is also a trait that makes this unique and priceless. When the thought or memory of a movie can drive you to emotions,the film must've worked,and Babe did just that for me. A great film library addition.\n",

            "Review 17: \"Babe\" is one of those films that is so warm, wholesome, funny, and dramatic that it is near impossible to dislike. All the animals on Farmer Hargett's land (played quietly by Oscar-nominated James Cromwell) are as real and vulnerable as regular people. One animal, the titled pig, has a heart of gold that will forever alter all the beings in the film for the better. Chris Noonan's direction (Oscar-nominated) and the amazing special effects, which were done primarily by Jim Henson's creature shop, give the film a genuine feel to it. There was no over- indulgence either as the film runs a crisp 92 minutes minutes. Stands very tall with \"Braveheart\" and other notable pictures of 1995. 5 stars out of 5.\n",

            "Review 18: Babe is one of the cutest movies already made! It's the story of a little pig, who starts living in the farm of the farmer Arthur Hoggettt and Esme Hoggett.There,he meets many new animals,like the Sheepdogs Fly and Rex,their puppies,Maa the Ewe and Ferdinand the duck,among other animals.Winning the respect of his new owner Arthur,Babe needs to prove that he is more than an ordinary pig, who was born to be human's food: he enters the competition for the sheepdogs and wins of all the pedigree-winning animals. His trick is to be polite with the other animals, different from the sheepdogs, that only achieve their tasks being rude to the ewes. Babe is a cute movie, not only for kids,but also for adults. It has a powerful message about being polite and helping others and also to never let anyone put you down, saying that you were not capable to do something.\n",

            "Review 20: I'm surprised that none of the reviews I read of Babe (there are 146 of them) mentioned the music. How can you watch this and not be moved by the terrific use of music? Well, quite simply, you can't I think. Still it seems that no one is consciously aware enough of the music to even mention in their reviews. Just today, I heard the 4th movement of Camille Saen Sans 3rd Symphony, the \"organ symphony\", and immediately I was reminded of the movie.Yes, the movie was very good. Good story, good actors, great use of animals to portray the main characters. But if you look at the IMDb listing for the movie, way, way, down at the very bottom, there's a link to the \"soundtrack\". I suggest you check it out to see what else makes this movie so good. They didn't have to hire John Williams to compose great new music. They were smart enough to intelligently use some great old music.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112431/soundtrack\n",

            "Review 21: This is a masterful story of a little pig, who, like the one in Charlotte's Web, is one step away from the Hormel plant. The reason the movie works so well, is that we see the musings of Babe about the everyday events that take place on the farm. Each of the animals has a set of human qualities, pride, stubbornness, stupidity, you name it. The farmer is that. He doesn't see the animals in any particular way; they are farm animals. What they do in the scheme of things determines their value. When Babe shows an aptitude for rounding up sheep, he becomes of greater value. Even his name is the name that all the little pigs in his litter were called. Things develop as a result of a jealous dog who sees his role threatened. James Cromwell is wonderful as the farmer. He uses that wonderful long face to show expressions, so subtle. He is a serious man, which is probably about par for the course among farmers. But he has a joyous side he doesn't show often. There are some scenes of genuine affection toward the little pig. Maybe it's just that we are all God's creatures and entitled to a little kindness along the way. My kids loved this movie when they were small. We loved it too.\n",

            "Review 22: \"Babe\" seems like the sort of movie that could come out mind-numbingly sappy. But they did a very good job with it. Portraying a pig becoming a sheep herder, one gets a look into the world as seen by farm animals. Probably the most perceptive aspect was the part about why sheep think that all dogs are wolves. As someone who usually takes no stock in movies like this, I definitely recommend this movie. And above all, this movie showed what a great actor James Cromwell is. Also featuring the voice of Hugo Weaving (of \"The Matrix\" and \"V for Vendetta\" fame). Check it out.Bah-ram everyone!\n",

            "Review 23: Some films are so enjoyable that it is nearly impossible not to smile through them as they teach subtle lessons, and Babe is one of the best. It is the odd being that can't laugh at the antics of the animals of Farmer Hoggit's farm as Ferdinand, a duck tries to usurp the role of the rooster, three literate and musical mice read title cards aloud for younger audience members, and best of all, Babe, a Hoy piglet, learns the job of the brilliant herding dogs Rex and Fly, to win the annual sheep herding competition. Clever animation, well done animatronic creature-doubles, and a menagerie of superbly trained farm animals makes the story of the little pig who could be more than just bacon for breakfast a film for the entire family. A simple story that underscores that hard work and tolerance for those different from oneself is to be respected in the kingdom of all animals, Babe certainly brings to the screen through comedy and drama, lessons all ages can understand. As Babe grows bigger through the great job of fattening up by Mrs. Hoggit, he makes friends with a sheep who conveys much wisdom about the rules of farm life where Rex is the dominant working dog, and the sheep are considered ignorant. However, Farmer Hoggit and Babe share a special relationship that confounds his wife, the sheep dogs, and the sheep. Hoggit trains Babe how to herd sheep and he's a mighty smart and fast learner, ultimately changing the rules that dominated the pecking order of the barnyard - \"because that's the way it's always been\" with good manners and friendship.James Cromwell as Farmer Arthur Hoggit gives an understated and superb performance as the patient farmer who is willing to give a young pig a chance. This is one of the most delightful family films which is perfect for seasonal get-togethers or just because its a nice change to see a film devoid of car chases, explosions, and four letter words, yet adult in its message as well. Every library should have its own copy of little Babe, a Pig of Destiny.\n",

            "Review 25: My Take: The CITIZEN KANE of talking animal movies.For many years, BABE has been on the same line as THE WIZARD OF OZ and E.T., as a classic family film. It even made a runaway success in the box-office, charming audiences around the world in theaters back at 1995. It even made quite an impression in the Oscars being nominated even for Best Picture and 6 other Oscars (winning one for Best Special Effects, winning it fair-and-square from APOLLO 13). So with all the buzz that's still going on with BABE, is it really that great! For most parts, BABE still lives up to its title, \"The little film that could\".While it ain't quite as perfect as the films I've mentioned above, BABE still deserves its place as a classic family film choice. It's painted with creative storyline, interesting characters and simply delightful moments of joy, fear, sadness and sweet triumph. Sure, it's only an \"Animals-can-talk\" movie, but this is the smartest one to date, and still is. Before being bogged down into terribly mediocre films like RACING STRIPES, talking animal movies can actually potentially achieving as this one. The characters, both human and animals, are given a surprising depth. In the animals, of course, there's Babe (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh), a curious and benevolent piglet with a lot of kindness in his heart, yet must go through depression and sadness a the same. His life leaves little less value to humans, who doesn't see him more than just another feast for the Holiday season. That is, except for the compassionate farmer Arthur Hoggett (James Cromwell), the most valuable human character in the movie, who sees his talents as a pig who actually knows how to herd sheep (by talking to them respectively, no less).BABE maybe a straightforward children's film, but it no doubt still has power to charm any adult audience out there, thanks to its adult script, thankfully co-written by George \"MAD MAX\" Miller adapted from a novel by Dick King-Smith, and an especially endearing performance by the underrated James Cromwell as the farmer. The special effects too are worth mentioning, as they are a convincing alternation between animatronic creations and real, trained animals. But BABE will be best remembered, not as a technical marvel, but a clever and imaginative story. \"That'll do.\" says the farmer. Enough said.Rating: ***** out of 5.\n",

            "Review 1: Tim Robbins's 'Dead Man Walking' is a brave piece of cinema. Though the film is about a man on death row and a nun's struggle to help him, I liked how he presented both sides of the central theme of capital punishment. This isn't a preachy film about capital punishment being wrong or right as I doubt one's opinion would change on that after watching the movie. But, it's more of a subtle movie that tells the story of two people who form an unlikely friendship.This couldn't have been an easy film to make yet he manages to pull it off. Poncelet is a ruthless murderer and in no way does Robbins condone what he has done but he and actor Sean Penn manage to win Poncelet the viewer's sympathy. The execution is terrific. The last scene particularly stands out. We see, in flashback, what had happened while Poncelet meets his ultimate fate. We see how he and Helen make the final connection, we see remorse in his eyes, we see him dying a slow death and at the same time the horror of the crime is exposed to us. We know that what he did is unforgivable but he finally took responsibility for that which allows us to see him as a human being rather than a ruthless killer. This also makes the whole tragedy more astonishing because you just ponder, like Sister Helen, on how such a normal human being commit such a heinous deed? Both Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon deliver powerful performances. We pretty much see most of the film from Helen's point of view. Sarandon clearly has put a lot of heart into the role as she skillfully downplays her part showing tremendous depth and pathos. Sean Penn plays his difficult complex character with ease. The supporting cast do well (watch out for a young Jack Black and Peter Sarsgaard).The score is mesmerizing, especially the Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan tracks. I also felt that sense of isolation that was brought out in the prison scenes. The terrific writing grips the viewer's attention right from the start. Even though we can predict Poncelet's fate, we are drawn into the fascinating transforming journey of these two intriguing characters.\n",

            "Review 2: I haven't seen many films that really, truly made me rethink a long-held position or opinion on a thorny issue, but \"Dead Man Walking\" is one of them.I read Sr. Helen Prejean's book, upon which this film was based, when it first came out in 1993.  At that time I was utterly supportive of capital punishment -- to quote the script, I felt anyone who committed crimes horrible enough to land them on Death Row was an \"expendable human being, suckin' up tax dollars.\"  I also had personal experience with the issue when an entire family whom I knew in my childhood were slaughtered by a man who is now on Death Row for his crimes.As you might imagine, I was disgusted with Sr. Helen's book.  I thought that trotting to death row and holding the hand of some scumbag who'd killed innocent people was about the lowest thing anyone could do, and as a Catholic I was offended by the seeming hypocrisy of it.Because I had disliked the book, I never saw the film until about two weeks ago, when I bought a remaindered copy of it in a video store.  I have watched it four times since then, mostly because I am trying to work out my feelings on it.  I am still a supporter of capital punishment, but it's going to be less easy for me to ignore the fact that (to quote again), \"There's nobody with money on Death Row\" -- and quite a few more blacks, now that I think of it, AND the fact that, like Matthew Poncelet's character, the men who are being executed are human beings who have feelings and fears. It's easy to jeer at Matthew on the day before his execution, fretting nervously about whether the lethal injection will \"hurt,\" like a little boy at the doctor's office for a penicillin shot, since his victims' last moments certainly \"hurt.\" What isn't easy is to realize that while the victims of these inmates didn't know they were about to die until it was too late, the inmates themselves have what seems like a blessing at first, but upon deeper examination is the greatest curse:  knowing the exact hour and day they will die, and having to face it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute.I'm sorry if this review offends people who are sincere death penalty supporters.  I still consider myself to be one, but my thinking has been reformed somewhat and I'm more ready to listen to the opponents and try to make compromises; maybe that's what this issue needs more than anything.  I will say finally that ONE part of this film did offend me as a Catholic: the symbolic \"crucifixion\" of Poncelet during the \"last words\" scene.  That was the one place where Robbins strayed from his even-handed approach to the issue -- the only one I could find.In all, this was a fine film that made me rethink an explosive issue, and I recommend it highly to anyone debating the pros and cons.\n",

            "Review 3: 'It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'Set in St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, \"Dead Man Walking\" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana nun Sister who befriended Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the endan act never before attempted by a woman At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life The film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die alone As Poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him In one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being there Poncelet never understood that he has robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrow They are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them In the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity Luckily both Sarandon and Penn are here exceptionalcarrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls When Sarandon was looking at Penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears She asks him to visualize her as he dies ''I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love''in that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for him\n",

            "Review 4: Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this film. I say this because he avoided convention and cliché. He also oversaw superb performances from Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing, Robbins doesn't patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this film enough, 9/10.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 5: What's really good about \"Dead Man Walking\" is that it shows Matthew Poncelet's (Sean Penn) side of the story, but it never portrays him as a hero. We understand that, and Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) understands that. Sarandon definitely deserved her Best Actress Oscar for this movie (I can't believe that it took her so long to win one). Never preachy, the movie shows all sides of the story in looking at Poncelet's approaching execution. Among other things, this movie should dispel the notion that they don't make movies like they used to - although this one is over ten years old. A true classic in every sense of the word.\n",

Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Katherine Hepburn, Bogart, Anthony Hopkins, Day-Lewis, Denzel, Nicholson, Caine, the list goes on.My husband and I tend to watch actors that we love and then watch all of their movies. Sean Penn has an amazing body of work. We don't care if an actor truly transforms themselves to play a role (but that's impressive) as much as we care about how authentic a performance is. For example, Michael Caine is pretty much always similar and yet he's compelling in every performance he's ever given. But Sean Penn gives a performance here that is next level. Touched by God is the only way to describe it.\n",

Sean Penn is nothing less than awesome in a film that is as unflinching, intelligent, and thoughtful about the death penalty as any film could be.  Writer/director Tim Robbins shows a depth beyond any reasonable expectation, Susan Sarandon is wonderful as the strong moral center of the film, and Sean Penn's performance is one of the most specific, thought provoking and eerily realistic performances ever put on film.  In short, his performance is a masterpiece, as is this important film.\n",

            "Review 8: In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick.  And to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not.  At the heart of `Dead Man Walking,' directed by Tim Robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand.  And it is what this film is actually all about:  Forgiveness.  Real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.\tDirector/screenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in God.  As chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola.  Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience.  And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience.  Through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.\tFor her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began).  Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization.  It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. \tTurning in a career-best performance, as well, is Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost out to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in `Leaving Las Vegas).  Perfect for the part in every way, Penn has quite simply never been better, before or since.  He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here.  Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact.  It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things.  And that's the strength of Penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul.  A terrific performance, and -- as good as Cage was in `Vegas'-- Penn should have received the Oscar for it.\tIn another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Poncelet's victims. With limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface.  Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.\tThe supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet).  It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what Robbins has accomplished with `Dead Man Walking.'  Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness.  For, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work.  And it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her.  I rate this one 10/10.\n",

            "Review 9: The story of a nun who is assigned to be the spiritual advisor of a man who has only a short time to live before his execution. He has already been on death row for six years. He and another man have been convicted of the brutal murder of a couple out parking in the woods.The dialogue is fantastic as Sister Helen has meaningful discussions with not only our 'dead man' Matthew Poncelet, but also his family and the families of the victims involved. The film builds in intensity until unleashing a stunning and gripping conclusion that left me deeply moved. It's also an educational piece on the lethal injection process, something most people would have no clue about before viewing this film. Both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn exhibit phenomenal acting from beginning to end. You can see real emotion in their faces and movements especially towards the end. There's not one moment in the film that feels unnecessary, not one moment in the film that seems contrived. Everything feels real and the direction (from Tim Robbins, who played the main character in The Shawshank Redemption only a year earlier) attests to its greatness.It's a bit of casting cleverness that Scott Wilson - who played one of the two killers in 1967's \"In Cold Blood\" - is playing a chaplain here.A couple of points - Matt starts out manipulative with Prejean even trying some pedestrian jail house come on initially, but she lets him know where things stand right off the bat. I wonder if he would have ever taken responsibility for what he did and admitted his crimes to Sister Prejean if he was not about to be executed. Bravado seems to be a big part of his identity. He ultimately admits he would not have been in the woods doing what he did to get to death row if he had the courage to stand up to his crazy companion and just walk away.And this is the thing about these kinds of cases, the individual is on trial, but often it is two people together each of whom can't back down in the presence of the other who do the most gruesome crimes. It really is the bad company they choose and poor impulse control when free to make those choices that leads to their downfall. Some call it the synergy of evil.\n",

Writer-director Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays.  Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture.  The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film.  Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.  4.5 out of 5 stars.\n",

They create characters that are completely believable and are shown uncloaked. They are human beings, not perfect heroes.Robbins never try to excuse or diminish the horrible nature of the crime committed by Penn's character. He shows us the grief of the victim's family. He never spares any side of the story. We are in fact shown every side of the death penalty debate and we are left to draw our own conclusion.I thought it was a brave move when you consider Robbins and Sarandon's well known position.

            "Review 12: \"Dead Man Walking\" is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I find it hard to believe that anyone, after having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the film or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers, but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. I have always known where I stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder *anyone*.Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Academy Award was very well-deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage does a great job in \"Leaving Las Vegas\", I would have been happier if Penn had won the award. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the Academy Award she won.

Whatever my views on the subject, I struggled to connect with any of the characters presented (on both sides) as deeply as I would have liked, performances were fine but not outstanding, I'm not sure the story was even that unique or original by todays standards.The one thing that does irritate however, that societies and cultures fail to resolve the root of the problem, that those with less opportunity continue to lose what little they have and the net that should save people form falling into chaos continually becomes smaller and more threadbare.

            "Review 14: Coming from the Hollywood couple notorious for their strong political convictions and social consciousness, \"Dead Man Walking\" is a multi-layered and thorough examination of a controversial issue.  With this film, Tim Robbins really proves himself as a writer and a director, leaving no stones unturned in addressing the many key elements of capital punishment.  In what I consider the best film of 1995, Robbins' take on the death penalty is both compassionate and incisive.  Though he, Susan Sarandon, and Sister Helen Prejean (the Catholic nun who wrote the book upon which the movie is based) are against the death penalty, \"Dead Man Walking\" goes to great lengths to encourage debate and to examine the issue from all angles.  It provides us with just as many arguments for capital punishment as it provides against capital punishment.\"Dead Man Walking\" is perhaps most successful in depicting the families of both the murderer and his two victims.  The scene in which Sister Helen visits Mr. Delacroix (father of the male victim) after he has criticized her for not doing so in the first place is particularly moving.  As the scene ends, the camera slowly moves back, revealing a quiet and still living room. This shot alone perfectly suggests the shattering toll a murder takes on a family.  In fact, this film has plenty of subjective camerawork that is both subtle and potent at the same time.  Never does Robbins' feel that he has to hammer in the pain that these families face.Sean Penn gives the performance of his career as Matthew Poncelet, the trailer-trashy and racist death-row inmate.  This is the role that should have won him the Oscar, had there been any justice.  A great testament to Penn's acting is that he does not try to win sympathy for his character.  He simply plays Poncelet as is, and presents him as human, in the process.  I have seen this film many times over the years and my heart still skips a beat when Poncelet finally lets go of his ego and owns up to his responsibility in the murders.Susan Sarandon is simply wonderful as Sister Helen Prejean, playing her with a combination of bravery and vulnerablility.  It is also great to see a Catholic nun depicted in a non-stereotypical way.  Just as Penn gives a human face to a hardened criminal, Sarandon makes Sister Helen equally human.I also strongly recommend the book!  I have read it twice myself and I am sure that I will be affected by it once more the next time I pick it up.  By reading the book, you will notice that Robbins has taken a few liberties with the actual events.  The character Matthew Poncelet is actually an amalgamation of two death row inmates that Sister Helen describes in her book.  The spirit and compassion of the book is dead-on accurate.  It amazes me that Robbins' screenplay adaptation was not even nominated for an Oscar in addition to the other four nominations this movie did receive.  As far as I am concerned, Robbins' direction and writing are assured, and I continue to look forward to his next projects.\n",

            "Review 17: SpoilersThe easiest thing is to turn a comment on DMW into en emotional debate on capital punishment. Let's just put that aside for a moment. Watching the scene of the last gathering with the family in the afternoon before the midnight execution may make some of us recall similar images, of sitting around with beloved family and friends, saying a different kind of goodbye. The comparison is not that ridiculous, and the sentiment is well reflected in songs over the years, from 'Harbor Light' to 'Leaving on a Jet Plane'. And the similarity is not that far fetched, as in some cases, you may not know when you'll see them again. You try to sound controlled, engage in small talks, refusing to break down. Then you hear 'Now is the Hour' (for those who still remember that one) in your mind. Among other things, DMW focuses on the development of the relationship between two people, convicted murderer-rapist Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) who struggles to grab a straw to haul himself out of the death sentence and Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who answers to that call but is not sure of she can handle the challenge. It's most interesting to observe how the camera takes us through the stages of this development. We start out seeing them exactly the way they see each other, through the wire screen that divides the prisoner and the visitor. Then, the camera moves past the wire screen, and we start to see the faces behind them, but with the shadow of the grate cast on the faces. Then, we finally get the clean shots of the faces, as if there is nothing between them. Once we get beyond realism into the camera's world, various techniques present interesting possibilities. Effectively used is the favorite technique of simultaneously showing the face of the speaker as-is, and the reflection of the listener on the glass panel dividing them. We also see dialogues presented in sideways profiles of the faces of the two facing each other from opposite ends of the movie screen. Through these visual images, we follow the development of the relationship between these two human beings from the initial stance of sizing up each other, to the silent shaping of the final words 'I love you' and 'I love you too' (not in any erotic sense) the minute before the execution.In addition to the very fundamental premises like good and evil, faith, forgiveness, prejudice, DMW touches on many other things. For example, there is the issue of how to survive after losing a child. Two recent good films dealing with this that immediately come to mind are In the Bedroom and Moonlight Mile. Susan Sarandon actually starred in the latter.As the depiction of the two key characters deepens, we see more and more of their human side. When confronted by victim's father Earl Delacroix, Sister Helen is caught a little unprepared, and, after trying to explain that she did not intent to ignore the victims' parents, offers her card and asks him to call her when in need. 'Me call you? How arrogant!' said Earl Delacroix. Of course, he is absolutely right. This just goes to show that to err is human and Sister Helen is, after all, human. For Matthew Poncelet, we see him playing cool and tough throughout most of the film, but finally breaks down, regretting that his tough talks about wanting to join the Nazis had reduced his already slim chance for pardon. And both are not devoid of a sense of humor. Even on the day before the execution, when Matthew lights a cigarette, Sister Helen quips, 'Those things will kill you'.Most of the audience would have at least some degree of sympathy for Matthew, until toward the very end when it is revealed that he did take part in the murder and rape. At that point, some of those sympathy would evaporate, I'm not sure how much, but would think a lot. Even if the final verdict is that he deserves capital punishment, there is still one question. The prison guard said to Sister Helen, 'In Louisiana, when we say life sentence, it is' (something to that effect), meaning that there is absolutely no chance of parole. I'm not sure, which is the worse punishment, and which fits the crime  being put to death or allowed to live on with no hope of ever leaving the prison cell.Sean Penn got a shot at the Oscar, and lost to Nick Cage. Lost two more tries (1999, 2001) and finally won last year with Mystic River. Susan Sarandon won her well deserved Oscar, after 4 previous tries (starting in 1981 with Atlantic City), a gift of sorts form husband and director Tim Robbins.\n",

            "Review 18: I'm astonished how a filmmaker notorious for his political left-wing fervor could make such a subtle, non-sanctimonious picture. If you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. If you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it. But whatever your stance is, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. There's not one false note in the film.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 19: One of the greatest filmed examples of unconditional love ever. Robbins explores the effect our social standing & class position can have on our future, our behavior, & our decisions. It empathizes with Penn but never lets him off the hook, even at the very end. He is forgiven, but responsible. He is punished, yet freed. Sarandon is as masterful as ever, & Penn's ultimate confession to her is full of striking truth & palpable liberty.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 20: This film is a perfect example of Film as a combination of art and entertainment and social consciousness.  \"Dead Man Walking\" is less about capital punishment than about personal responsibility and redemption.  Based on the book by Sister Helen Prejean, who spent many years helping death row inmates come to terms with their crimes and punishments, this film rises above the debate about whether it's wrong to \"kill someone to show that killing someone is wrong\". You find yourself caring about everyone in this movie:  the young rape/murder victims; their grieving parents, one filled with hate, the other two inconsolable; the parents of the perpetrator of this crime; the nun who tries to do God's work in a place that is literally the last stop before hell for many men; even the prison guards who must do their job calmly and competently as they guide a man across the River Styx.Sean Penn is an actor on the calibre of James Dean, reaching deep inside himself and putting his emotions on the table.  Here, he somehow manages to find the right blend of odious and pathetic, and his portrayal is so very real that it hurts, even though his character is not a nice person at all. Susan Sarandon and hubby-director Tim Robbins have created a masterpiece, which provokes thought and discussion long after the film is over.  This movie runs deep, but rather than resort to shameless manipulation and plot devices, it is real, and tough, and touching.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 21: Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) works with the poor and befriends Death Row Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) held in the Louisiana State Penitentiary. She had never visited a prison. He was convicted of killing a teen couple but he insists that his older partner Carl Vitello had actually done the killing. He seems to be a well-mannered but slightly racist. He asked for her help and she brings in lawyer Hilton Barber (Robert Prosky) to try for a pardon. Politics is pushing for his execution. She meets his mother and the parents of his victims.At first, one expects a Hollywood innocent man falsely convicted. However, the movie unfolds in a way that it's more about the characters. The acting is superb. Sarandon is compelling but Sean Penn is sublime. He embodies the dark side even as he pleads his innocence. It's enhanced by the different versions of the incident. The big scene for me is the family preparing for the execution. Roberta Maxwell is amazing in her scenes. There is something very haunting about the regimented procedures of that day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 22: Tim Robbins takes this film beyond its implicit political message and produces a moving piece of art.  Though the underlying anti-death penalty moral is prevalent, the director never becomes tendentious.  He intersperses the plight of death row inmate Matthew Poncelet with gruesome, if not surreal, images of the crime that he committed.  And where one would expect a juxtaposition of the brutality of Poncelet's (and his co-perpetrator's) nefarious act with an equally cruel demonstration of state-sponsored execution, Robbins shows Poncelet's death to be clinical and quiet in comparison to his sordid deed.  It is this type of restraint that not only adds credibility to the work but also power.\n",
            "\tThe performances of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon as Poncelet and Sister Helen Prejean respectively, are stellar.  Penn's grim nuance pervades his character as he moves from stoical rancor to the contrition that provides the denouement.  With the incisiveness in which his acting has become associated he provides the edge in which Sarandon impinges her role. Appearing perpetually exhausted, she immerses herself in the sturm and drang of her part and counters Penn's fringe with an enveloping emollient.  Even her expostulations and attempts to save Poncelet from perdition do not even approach pontification or the banal.\n",
            "\tIn the end this movie did not change my opinion on the death penalty; such conversions only occur via gradation.  However it did leave a lasting impression on me as powerful as its provocative subject matter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 23: This movie was suspenseful, riveting and emotional. A pure drama that contained a unique look at the death penalty system - from a legal and personal point of view.Fortunately, the movie was very evenhanded. I felt good arguments were being made for and against. Though it should be pointed out that any arguments for or against were tucked neatly away behind the scenes.The real point of the movie was the relationship between Susan Sarandon (nun) and Sean Penn (murderer). Both performances were worthy of Oscar consideration and expressed the enormously intense emotions which take place during the final weeks of one's life on death row. I certainly will never look at it the death penalty without seeing it in through the prism of this movie.Why not a 10? I don't know. I guess I just want to give 10's to movies that I love. Though this movie was brilliant and I know of no legitimate criticism, a 9 it is for me. Hard to love death penalty stuff.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 24: Susan Sarandon is wonderful in Oscar-winning role as real-life Sister Helen Prejean, an opponent of the death penalty who stirred controversy for befriending a scurrilous killer on Death Row--and finding his heart in the process. Writer-director Tim Robbins, obviously an opponent of the death penalty himself, lays on the life-in-prison propaganda pretty thick and some of his touches are uncomfortable or heavy-handed (especially when killer becomes victim, crucified on the table); however, Robbins handles the actors just right, especially real-life love Sarandon, who has seldom been shown to such an incredible advantage. The snappy repartee in the early part of the picture feels a little 'Hollywood', but Robbins enjoys a good verbal battle and nearly every sequence between Sarandon and Sean Penn is the stuff of powerful human drama. Based upon Sister Prejean's book, this is thoughtful, heady cinema. *** from ****\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 25: It may seem weird that in my one line summary that I said that Tim Robbins is amazing while the film has such great acting and feeling that I mention Robbins.  Well, Robbins has proved himself with this film as a incredible film-man, who can act, produce, and now write and direct (even though he made a satire in 1992).  He delivers a powerful (if not climatic) film with 2 performances that make this film all the worth while- Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.  Penn (in a Oscar nomination nabbing role) plays a convicted killer of 2 people on death row and Sarandon (in a Oscar nabbing role) as the nun who is trying to redeem him before he passes on.  To some it might seem boring that there is no plot and only a story.  But to these same people they probably thought Blankman was the best film of the year.  A great director (like Robbins) can tell a story and keep (some of) a audience in control and awe.  This film does that, without revealing if it is for or against the death penalty.  One of the best films of 1995. A+\n",

            "Review 1: Director Amy Heckerling knows a thing or two about high school flicks, having directed the highly successful `Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from `Fast Times', which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school `in-crowd'.  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.The story focuses on Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), who is the most popular girl at Beverly Hills H.S.  Cher seems to be a superficial airhead, but this belies her conniving and manipulative skills at getting what she wants.   Superficial yes, airhead no!  In a plot derived in part from Jane Austen's `Emma', Cher works behind the scenes to arrange love matches between various students.  She even orchestrates a relationship between two teachers to improve their moods so they don't grade so harshly.  Like Emma, she is a master of love for everyone but herself.Heckerling does a fantastic job of presenting what seems on the surface to be a cotton candy story with lightweight characters, but really runs much deeper revealing subtle truths about human nature.  Her direction of the fledgling cast is superb, milking every ounce of comedy out of each scene.Silverstone sparkles in the role, which is probably not far from a reality with which she is very familiar.  She actually attended Beverly Hills H.S. with co-star Breckin Meyer, although she didn't graduate due to career commitments (she received a G.E.D.).  This film catapulted her to teen prominence with two MTV movie awards and an American Comedy Award as funniest actress in a leading role.  She plays Cher with both arrogance and vulnerability, and her comic timing is impeccable.  She also has a knack for physical comedy, with a broad range of contorted facial expressions and amusing use of body language.  The rest of the teen cast is also great, especially Brittany Murphy as Tai and Breckin Meyer as Travis.  Dan Hedaya is also priceless as Cher's work obsessed attorney father.This film is easy to like.  It is a light and funny spoof, but it still has nuance.  I rated it an 8/10.  For those who enjoy high school comedies, this is required viewing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 2: Clueless (1995) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture surrounds Cher, a upscale high school student with good grades, looks and lots of money. As she looks for love she's also happy playing match maker for her friends and a particular new student. As everyone starts finding love she finds herself starting to get jealous.This movie is directed by Amy Heckerling (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and stars Alicia Silverstone (Batman & Robin), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Stacey Dash (Moving), Donald Faison (Scrubs), Jeremy Sisto (Wrong Turn) and Wallace Shawn (The Princess Bride).The writing for this picture is excellent with fantastic characters, dialogue and circumstances. The cast is perfectly selected and Silverstone delivers her character to perfection. The soundtrack is also good as is the comedic content. The terminology is good and the teachers matchmaking, driving scenes and couples conversations all made me crack up.Overall this is a very well done picture that is an absolutely must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 3: Considering how long removed I am from both the '90s and high school, there's something entirely relatable about Clueless - and I'm as surprised as anyone. Alicia Silverstone is beyond charming and there's plenty of humor in the supporting cast as well (in particular, the late Brittany Murphy, incandescent in her own right). But the dialogue really put me back in that high school mindset, and I think the movie strikes a nice balance between satire and teen fluff. Like Mean Girls, this is a movie that I've dismissed over the years for being shallow, and for the life of me I can't explain why. This is good stuff.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 4: Just the other day I watched Heckerling's wonderful romantic comedy satire 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' and I thought I'd revisit 'Clueless'. The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.Then the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).Alicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.For me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick. It's a highly entertaining satire and it's a nuanced teen comedy with a subtle social comment.\n",

            "Review 5: \"Isn't my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972.\"When romantic high-school comedy Clueless (1995) was released, it was immediately vaulted into cult-status and firmly stapled as one of the most original teen-flicks of the 1990s. 'Original' is perhaps a term wrongly applied since it is based on the queen of romance Jane Austen's Emma (1815) . But what Clueless did was update the classic story by coating it with high school drama, teenage girls and shopping and sprinkle it with heavy doses of humour.Emma is no longer Emma; she is Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a spoiled rich girl walking around in her Beverly Hills mansion in a bubble of stereotypes and teen-clichés -- but with a great big heart. So big-hearted, in fact, that she takes on the lost goofy new girl in her school to find her love and popularity, knowing full-well that it could destroy her own reputation. Clueless thus sees Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) on a mission to do good. Real good.All the detours this mission entail are captured brilliantly in the film, taking the form of love-interests, parties, shopping and misunderstandings. From Cher's grumpy lawyer-father (an hilarious Dan Hedaya) and her nerdy step-brother (a likable Paul Rudd) to her eccentric group of friends at school, Clueless is a superb ride of teenage comedy camp. Only just over 10 years old, it is still extremely dated today. But no matter, because the 90s clichés like skateboarding, Marky Mark and the catch-phrase \"As if\" just make it so much more contemporary and fun to watch. What elevates Clueless (1995) above generic high school comedy is its use of stereotypes. In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their 'problems' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10\n",

            "Review 6: Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those '80s teen-flicks, \"Clueless\" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone's father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's \"Emma\" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****\n",

            "Review 7: \"Let's set 'Emma' in a modern high school!\"  Does this sound the obvious kind of movie gimmick that everyone uses nowadays?  Perhaps, but it's an inspired idea all the same.  Jane Austen's characters, and her readers, and the society in which her novels are set, like Jane Austen herself, are HEAVILY conscious of class and social standing.  No atmosphere quite so snobbish exists in the modern world.  EXCEPT, that is, in the corridors and courtyards of the right kind of high school.  And where else in the modern world would you find so many people who seem to spend all their time calling on one another?I was reminded of how well Heckerling moulded \"Emma\" to fit a modern setting when I saw the idiotic 1998 version of \"Great Expectations\", adapted by someone who somehow failed to notice how important all the stuff about class and snobbishness was.  It's clear that Heckerling understood her source. She isn't afraid to make changes - even radical changes, if the modern setting requires as much - and no character exists MERELY because they have an analogue in Austen's novel.  (The most crucial thing is that the Emma-equivalent be sufficiently charming; and so she is.)  The result is a film which is winning and satisfying, whether or not you know anything about the source material.\n",

            "Review 8: Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is a popular ditz at her local high school in Beverly Hills. She's a spoiled, pampered little princess with all the right social connections and endless wealth. However she has yet to find a man in her life - all the Baldwins (as she and her clique of friends call guys they like) have been taken.When Cher receives a foreign exchange student, she takes her under her wing and decides to try and find her a boyfriend - ironically without having her own yet. Predictability ensues.I read \"Emma\" in early high school as I'm sure most kids did, and the movie puts a clever spin on the tale. Alicia Silverstone is surprisingly good in her role, perfectly playing a blond bombshell without a brain but a good heart - only Reese Witherspoon has done such a good job recently at portraying the west coast bimbos. (No offense to the west coast bimbos out there.) The movie's director, Amy Heckerling, has always been rather reliable on the whole and her direction is solid here - she could have turned \"Clueless\" into a crude, unfunny sex comedy with little wit or brains, but instead she takes a rather dubious idea for a film and transforms it into a well-made, well-acted, funny, inspired, lively, witty satire.Much better than expected.\n",

I'm a guy and I'm not ashamed to admit I love this movie and one of my favorite movies. Easily one of the best \"teen\" movies ever made. It is 90's GOLD.Alicia Silverstone was PERFECT for this movie. You cannot cast anyone better for the part. She is gorgeous, likable, and just plain out gorgeous. Everyone wanted to be like her.... Barbie/Girl Next DoorThe story is interesting, pacing is great, music is great, cast (with many stars that later ended up being big as well).Yes, the ending is a bit creepy but that fits perfectly that she is clueless.

            "Review 10: This movie is way above so many of the others of its' kind. It's consumately likable, funny, sweet and sharp- the script is a killer, and the acting is fun and enjoyable.Part of the success of the film is due to the fact that it appeals to several different audiences, and on multiple levels. I first watched this movie with my mom, who loved the link it has to Jane Austen's Emma- all the main characters and the plot are direct modern equivalents to the novel. For instance, the famous passage in Emma inwhich Harriet burns all her \"mementos\" of Mr. Elton becomes the scene where Tai does so infront of Cher's gasfire. From this perspective alone, the movie is so fun and sharp to watch- even if your forte isn't usually American Teen High School comedy!But this movie works on a really dumbed down scale too- let's face it, not everyone is big on English literature. The movie has an awesome soundtrack, Paul Rudd is unbelievably cute as \"Mr Knightly\" or rather Josh- and my boyfriend leads me to believe that the same is true of Alicia Silverstone- who still sparkles 10 years later as a mid-nineties teen queen with good intentions, Cher. Her performance here is impossible not to warm too, unless you have some sort of grudge against Valley girls, inwhich case you might not like it so much. Seriously though, this film is a must see for anyone who likes some real quality comedy- I'm so fond of this film personally that I would suspect basically everyone would enjoy it.\n",

This film is VERY 90s and was a feel good film that was so enjoyable and fun to watch!Firstly, the soundtrack was iconic and fit the tone of the film so well. It included a lot of nostalgic tracks and captured what the 90s were really about!This movie was also pretty funny at points which made it super fun to watch! It was self aware in it's humour which I really liked, I found myself laughing throughout a lot of the movie.All the characters were exaggerated, but this definitely added to the charm. I loved Tai, Brittany Murphy was the perfect fit and she was so loveable and sweet. I think Travis was my favourite character though! I liked Cher's character development, and her relationship with her father was adorable. The romance between Josh and Cher was a little strange, but I could look past it. I'd also like to add that the dialogue was good and very iconic!Visually, it was a pleasing film to look at. I loved the costuming and outfits. The cinematography was good, not too flashy but it definitely didn't need to be! I liked a lot of the colour palettes too as they were bright and catch the audience's attention.Lastly, the pacing and structure was good and followed the theory of equilibrium. It was fast paced and chaotic in a good way, the run time went by quite fast! I didn't want it to end! However, I did love the ending; it was super happy and upbeat.\n",

            "Review 12: Based on the novel \"Emma\", this is the story of a privileged teen who attends Beverly Hils High. Cher (Alicia Silverstone)---and her coterie of friends---have the nicest cars and clothes. And they unabashedly accept their economic advantages, making them instruments for lampooning the Beverly Hills way of life.But Cher is also caring, introspective, and loyal. Like Elle in \"Legally Blonde\", she has a lifestyle that sports the trappings usually associated with a shallow character (plus she verbalizes in Valspeak), but she is a good person. And like a female version of Ferris Bueller, she has a superhero vibe, because she always seems to rise above the above the fray and to emerge unscathed from circumstances that would entangle others.Cher is a creation of director Amy Heckerling, and her supercool persona drives the film. As a result, \"Clueless\" is, at times, funny, joyous, romantic, and clever. It is also aided by a strong cast, featuring Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Dan Hedaya, and my favorite character actor, Wallace Shawn. It also features a great soundtrack.This is one of the best teen movies of all time. I will continue to rewatch this film even if I have to spend major ducats.\n",

The idea is somewhat simplistic, the plot is sort of predictable, and the young performers all look too old for their teenage characters, but these are all minor vices against this strong entry for the teen flicks genre, with a surprisingly very realistic and actually almost heartfelt performance by Alica Silverstone to top it all off.\n",

Clueless is the best thing she's ever done, in my opinion. It put Alicia Silverstone on the map. Well, that and Aerosmith videos. Silverstone is pitch-perfect as Cher, the role of her career. It's impossible not to like her in this movie. It's also pretty much the best thing Stacey Dash and Breckin Meyer ever did. Not to mention the first big role for Paul Rudd. As most everyone knows, it's based on Jane Austen's \"Emma.\" For a teen comedy, it's refreshingly smart. The story may not be all that but there's lots of good dialogue rather than a string of F-bombs or Stifler-like characters. One of the few memorable '90s comedies.\n",

Based loosely on Jane Austen's novel 'Emma', it came at the beginning of that run where the high school movie was coming back in fashion with the likes of American Pie, and where it was co-opting classic literary narratives to freshen the brew - 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' for Get Over It, 'Pygmalion' for She's All That, 'Twelfth Night' for She's the Man, and 'The Taming of the Shrew' for 10 Things I Hate About You.What registers about Clueless is how absolutely assured it is of its own sublime sense of satire. It has this delightful level of disconnect like a pantomime, and if it wasn't live action it could almost pass for a literal cartoon - it is that flamboyant, wacky and colourful. It's almost like some pop art masterwork - from the '60s-style title sequence, to the crazy choreographing of the classroom scenes and the pool party, to the supremely sharp dialogue and Alicia Silverstone's droll voiceover.And talking about Silverstone, my only (slightly underwhelming) reference points to date have been her limp cameo in Batman and Robin and in the long-forgotten time-travel comedy, Blast from the Past. The air of vapidity about her and the slowness of her drawl is so right for the Beverly Hills princess with just enough self-awareness to redeem her from totally fulfilling the airhead stereotype. She is adorable here and actually quite touching; just the like the film itself.\n",

            "Review 16: I wasn't expecting much of this movie, until I started seeing it. It turned out to be quite entertaining. \"Clueless\" is about the shallow and rather stupid rich girl Cher Horowitz, who only cares about herself and how popular she is. But then she starts this kind of 'project', together with her best friend. One of the aspects of this project is about making a new silly girl of their school look as 'cool' as they are. This 'silly' girl is very well performed by Brittany Murphy. I hardly recognized her! The lead role is for Alicia Silverstone who gives an excellent performance as well. Furthermore there is another great performance Paul Rudd (who we also know as Phoebe's boyfriend in \"Friends\"). Also Dan Hedaya and Breckin Meyer (Road Trip) are funny.Funny and very entertaining movie from the director of \"Look Who's Talking (Too). Definitely worth watching! 7,5/10\n",

            "Review 17: Watched this with Indy from the 1000 book and was sooooo pleasantly surprised.I'd never seen it before...really!...and was all prepared to be underwhelmed but it was a cracker. It smashed the 6 laugh test and was brisk and biting and sweet ... and wonderfully 90's.Lovely story...based (very loosely) on 'Emma', apparently. Paul Rudd wasn't the Paul Rudd we love today but you could see the charm there. And whatever happened to Alicia Silverstone!? My theory is Batman and Robin killed her career ... which is a true shame.A highly recommended 83/100.\n",

            "Review 19: This movie is another one of those feel good pictures you can't go wrong with. It's light and breezy like cruising the boulevard with the top down and it offers lots of laughs to boot.Amy Heckerling has brought us another winner with a great supporting cast. A young teenage girl coming of age in of all places, Beverly Hills. The lead character, \"Cher\" played brilliantly by Alicia Silverstone, is a self centered high school girl in the beginning of the picture who's only interests include clothes, cars and credit cards. As the film progresses, she begins to mature and actually begins to care about other people, not to mention her environment. It's worth renting anytime. Just like \"European Vacation\" it doesn't matter how many times you see it, it still makes you laugh and that's worth it all.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 20: Teen comedies are quite common, but \"Clueless\" has going for itself the fact that it transposes Jane Austen's \"Emma\" to mid-'90s Beverly Hills and plays with stereotypes there. We see how air-head Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) may not have a clue about the rest of the world, but her heart is always in the right place - maybe a little too much. And of course, who can forget how the movie introduced to national dialogue phrases like \"as if\".Overall, the movie functions as a sort of look at how the future would become. Maybe our society has gone too far in being like Cher. But anyway, it's just a great movie to watch. Also starring Dan Hedaya, Stacey Dash, and Brittany Murphy (happy birthday, Brittany!).Spa-rat-acus...I bet that culturally devoid people probably would say that.\n",

            "Review 21: I really enjoyed Clueless... I found it fun, charming and easy to like. It is loosely based on Emma, and while some of the book's issues are put across here, like social standing, the story was updated to make it appealing for teenagers, and it ticks almost all of the right boxes. A perfectly cast Alicia Silverstone positively sparkles in the title role of Cher, and she is further advantaged by a funny well-written script, a classic heart felt story, and very good performances from her co-stars, such as Brekin Meyer and Brittany Murphy. The direction by Amy Heckerling was also spirited. The film looks lovely, with very nice costumes and locations. My only two criticisms are that the film is a little long, and once or twice only when the story almost falls into predictability. Overall, a fun, engaging and well acted film, that I would definitely watch again. 8/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 22: Teen movies can really be a terrible plague. I've had other occasions where I didn't spare them criticism, and generally it's a style of cinema that I dislike a lot for its sheer stupidity. However, this comedy about a group of spoiled rich girls is a positive example, a film for teenagers that manages to have quality and grace, while being a satire, quite critical, on the materialism and consumerism of elite teenagers.Amy Heckerling had a brilliant idea to make a modern adaptation of the novel \"Emma\", by Jane Austen. Any and all of the author's material is guaranteed to be good, and if it is well used, it usually gives good results. And indeed, the essence of this book is here: a spoiled and superficial girl who learns more about life, finds true love and the most genuine kindness and altruism. This is the transformation we see in Cher, the blonde and exuberant heroine of this film. She lives with her father, a lawyer who doesn't seem to pay much attention to his daughter but who, in fact, has a way of doing so. And it is at school, and in the complicated universe of popularity-obsessed teenagers, that Cher moves for most of the film. Rich and beautiful, she has no problem assuming herself as a leader, at the top of that strongly elitist and prejudiced mini-society that is the universe of teenagers. And she doesn't hesitate to use it to try to improve things around her.This is the great movie of Alicia Silverstone's life. The actress still did some work later, and is known and respected, but the truth is that her career did not have such strong and relevant successes again. She embodied Cher in such a sincere and authentic way that it became difficult, from then on, to detach the character from the actress. Brittany Murphy also deserves a round of applause. She was incredibly young, but showed signs of talent and remained active as an actress until the end of her (unfortunately) brief life. Stacey Dash does what she can, but she doesn't have the time or material to shine like her peers. The film also has good performances by Dan Hedaya and Paul Rudd.The movie doesn't have amazing visuals or great effects, nor is it supposed to. In fact, one of the secrets to its success (commercially, of course) was the fact that it had an average budget and a remarkable success at the box office. Without an unlimited credit card, the production went to great lengths to make the film look more expensive than it is, and I believe that a good part of the investment went into the elegant and seemingly expensive costumes for the three main characters, as well as the house where Cher lives, a magnificent California mansion.\n",

            "Review 23: The movie - I thought this would just be a dumb chick flick and that's why I never saw it with my buds in high school when it came out, even though I was in love with Alicia like everyone else. But it's not that at all, just saw it a few weeks ago and it's just this fun and loveable movie that is light hearted and really funny. There is no big villain to overcome and the lead character is strange in a good way in that she is the ditzy rich popular girl but she is not mean and is actually really caring and helpful towards others. The cast is great and a lot of the lines are really funny. I lol'd HARD more than once. And I think the amorphous thing about the movie that is really key is just that I felt happy and in a great mood while watching and afterward. I've since watched it more than once and each time it just puts me in a great mood!Alicia - Ok, so I was 14 or 15 when she was in The Crush and for high school/junior high kids I think it was fairly well known because MTV made a big deal out of it at the time. Well I watched The Crush and thought she was really cute, then the Aerosmith videos came out and thought she was crazy sexy and cute at the same time. So my experience of Alicia until a few weeks ago watching this was crazy girl in the Crush and sexy silent girl in Aerosmith videos. While watching Clueless I was really shocked at how funny she can be and just how great at acting she is. Like super impressed. It changed my view of her as kind of just this young sex icon to a real deal actress. Now, having said that, I've also got to say that there were times and scenes in Clueless where it's literally just jaw dropping how gorgeous she is. Her eyes, lips, smile, hair - wow, one of the most beautiful combos of everything every to exist I think. And she doesn't have this stereotypical killer bod with giant chest or anything - she's just drop dead GORGEOUS. So that didn't hurt, but like I said, even if she wasn't 10/10 face she's just damn fun to watch and great at acting!Overall spectacular movie!\n",

            "Review 24: Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.\n",

            "Review 1: Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.\n",

            "Review 2: From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 3: Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  \"Se7en\" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10\n",

            "Review 4: After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. \"Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,\" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com\n",

            "Review 5: Seven is directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.An unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.Having been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\"But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever\"Seven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!Faultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to \"light\" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10\n",

            "Review 6: A retiring Detective and a young rookie are hunting down a serial killer, a killer with a dark MO, murdering his victims using the seven deadly sins.As I watch this, it's coming up to its thirtieth anniversary, and it's as fresh now as it was back in 1995, it's an intensely macabre take, crimes that are infinitely macabre and depraved, and intensely twisted.The combination of Freeman and Pitt is incredible, they work immensely well together, we have the fresh zest of Mills, and the unshakable, but battle weary Somerset. Paltrow and Spacey are excellent in support.Two hours flashed past, there is no lull, no moment to switch off and boil the kettle, the intensity is immediate, the pacing designed to keep you glued.I have always thought there is a shade of Alfred Hitchcock about this movie, such is the intelligence of the plot.Very good visuals, the macabre and gruesome bodies look shocking still, nothing is spared or hidden away.10/10.\n",

            "Review 7: Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the \"cops on trail of deranged killer\" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.\n",
            "The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 8: It is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping.David Fincher's story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city (never named) where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant. Coming up to his retirement from the police force is Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) before leaving. Somerset is world weary, under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and (initially) wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city. Mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct, bringing his wife to the city with him. Before Somerset can move on, a homicide comes in which he and Mills are assigned to investigate. But its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in Dante's \"The divine comedy\".To begin with, Se7en appears to be a standard \"cops on the trail of a killer\" story which shouldn't be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with. But as we descend along with the characters into the merciless, brutal world without hope that they inhabit, you are left reeling at the events that unfold.The two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them. The older Somerset is educated, astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out. Mills, who has no respect for Somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually. The further we get into the action, the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits.This film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as \"The Seventh Seal\" (1957). Both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all.Se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. The killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. It is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, Somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. This is lost on Mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point.A previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching Se7en and i completely agree. Eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen, it usually does. Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope. This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.Director David Fincher didn't pick up another script for 18 months, such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of Alien 3. Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity. He stated: \"It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it\". For the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score.The Most disturbing message that Se7en puts across, is that the fight against evil is destined to be a Pyrrhic victory. But regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost. We have no other choice.\"The World is a fine place and worth fighting for.\" I agree with the second part.\n",

            "Review 9: Despite clichés, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the \"Lethal Weapon\" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become \"buddies\" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to \"expect the unexpected\" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.\n",

            "Review 10: Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) a deeply Intellectual Detective, with barely a week left until his retirement and Mills, (Brad Pitt) the new cop in town, who is a pretty weak detective, are thrown together to investigate what at first appears to be another Homicide.After a second Victim is found, Somerset realises that this is no open and shut case, and requests that he is relieved, in light of his impending retirement. Mills gladly takes over the case and plunges himself in way over his head.As the work of a Crimally insane genius continues, Mills grows more and more erratic, and Somerset simply has to remain, to guide his young partner through the case, which ultimately leads to one of the finest climax's in movie history.With Wonderful Performances from both Freeman and Pitt and a really dark and morbid direction from David Fincher, the movie is crammed with suspense, intrigue and Excitement.My Favourite scene is John Doe (Kevin Spacey) tearing into Mills in the car, driving towards the Climax, the acting is simply perfect as Pitt's character is torn apart by the genius of the Criminally insane, and Freeman interjects with insightful rationality, demonstrating his superior mind. The Scene Carries such intensity, and at the same time encapsulates the primary characters basic elements. Most actors can't achieve this level of character depth, but these are three of the finest actors of our time. 10/10\n",

            "Review 11: Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting. David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.\n",

            "Review 12: A stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer, \"Se7en\" (along with \"Silence of the Lambs\"), is something of a milestone in this genre. An intelligent script, and admirable actors including the excellent Morgan Freeman, Prad Pitt, Gwenth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, with a cinema noir style, and very grisly murders representing the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the performances however that lifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older world wise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick, Poltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spacey does his usual brilliant psycho routine. There is a pivotal scene with Freeman and Paltrow in a café which shows the depth of performances here. They are believable characters in a dark disturbing world wherein it always seems to be raining. An effective thriller with tight direction and atmospheric photography.\n",

            "Review 13: David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful \"I'm taking you off the case!\" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew Kevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences experienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising vision.\n",

            "Review 14: `Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man.  With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him.  However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise.  Yes it wasn't a great film  but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created.  Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!Se7en was his major break through  where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold.  The story doesn't sound like much  mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless  the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller.  But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out.  From the start we are entombed in mood  the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc.  The we begin to find murders  but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest  Genius!What you don't see is more gory than what you do.  Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets betterright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen.  I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset  so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc.  But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer.  Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans  he spends a lot of it looking beaten up.  Paltrow is OK with what she has  but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles.  R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters.  He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly.  In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word.  However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller  but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's.\n",

            "Review 16: \"Se7en\" is unique because of the extraordinary sympathy it manages to foster for its two main characters; it's unique because of its bleak, hopeless environment that serves as a symptom of civilization's general decline. It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.Few forms of popular entertainment manage to afford the villain his say whilst still maintaining a sensible distance from his horrific acts. What I like best is the film's depressing contention that there isn't as much distinction as we think between the good guys and the bad guys. We're all affected by the distasteful aspects of society, but do we just hope that our own positive contributions will be enough to offset them - or in extreme situations, when we stare into the abyss, will the abyss stare back at us? Some may well be upset that the killer's justification contains reasoned objections. It is really only by resorting to crime that he reveals himself as a madman. Rather than be outraged, though, I prefer to celebrate good writing that allows us to see hidden facets of an issue, however unpalatable the resultant consequences of such a viewpoint may turn out to be.\n",

            "Review 17: ...and it was STILL STELLAR! Fincher's mid-90's crime drama SE7EN got a whole bunch of hype when it first came out, and deservedly so. Pitt was still on the upswing of his career, \"Gwyn\" was still not yet a household name (which was a good thing for this role), and of course Freeman was at the top of his game (see SHAWSHANK, UNFORGIVEN, OUTBREAK, etc.) once again playing the voice of reason to perfection. And throw in Spacey, who was still in the last stages of being a THAT GUY (albeit, one of the very best THAT GUYS-- he would pick up a Supporting Actor Oscar the next year for THE USUAL SUSPECTS), and you've got one helluva cast.But it wouldn't have all mattered if the story wasn't any good, and this one, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is top notch. I guess my only real beef is that we wait too long until we actually get involved visually with Spacey's John Doe. But once he shows, the movie is even more riveting down the stretch. The chase scene and then finally the car ride scene are tremendous, as is the final showdown which I won't spoil here but I think every movie buff is familiar with by now.WATCH IT AGAIN WHEN YOU CAN!\n",

            "Review 18: David Fincher has made remarkable films throughout his career, but 'Se7en' finds him at his FINEST! This neo-noir psychological-thriller, is an astonishing piece of Cinema. I was mesmerized. 'Se7en' Synopsis: Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi.'Se7en' is a Masterstroke from start to end. A dark, moody, violent & utterly gripping story, that keeps you at the edge-of-your-seat. There isn't a single dull moment in this blockbuster, in fact, the tale gets more & more intriguing as it progresses.Andrew Kevin Walker's Screenplay is Ace. It's a spine-chilling tale about two heroes out to get a psychotic killer. The Writing grips you from the moment it begins & refuses to let you go. Fincher's Direction is incredible. The way he has handled this twisted story, deserves an ovation. Darius Khondji's Cinematography is flawlessly done. Richard Francis-Bruce's Editing is tight. Action-Sequences are mind-blowing. Howard Shore's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: Morgan Freeman is at his understated best. The Oscar-Winning Legend delivers a master-class act here, that ranks amongst his finest to date. Brad Pitt is in terrific form, adding depth & anger to his part. Kevin Spacey is loathsome to the core in his creepy portrayal of the wicked villain. Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful in a brief, yet important role. On the whole, 'Se7en' is a film to die for. Two Big Thumbs Up!\n",

            "Review 19: In 1995 David Fincher released a perfectly constructed modern masterpiece; Se7en. One of the most exhilarating experiences of all-time and a classic to come.A cop; Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) has just moved into the city with his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) in hope of finally settling down. Mills will take over the job of Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) an old cop who has seven days until his retirement begins. Both are dedicated to the badge. They are put together on the case of an obesity murder, in which a man has been forced to 'eat till he bursts'. This then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it. This is just the beginning of a mass murder masterpiece crafted by the insane John Doe, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.Whatever you do while watching it, do not see it as hollow. Se7en is far from it. Many scenes study civilisation; present civilisation. And its evil. Our society isn't a pleasant one. The film concentrates mainly on the cops search; when it comes to the mystery part in finding the killer, we discover the policemen's differences in methods, and how the most obvious one does not actually work. Of course, its Somerset, the one with the most experience who has the best way. He tries to find out why. Why some man is killing these people using a specific punishment. While Mills tries, unsuccessfully, to find out how; by studying the crime scene for clues. He ends up bored. With the help of the library, Somerset gets closer to the murderer. It may seem as though the role of Tracey is a pointless part, but she is more important than anything. She is the one who brings the men to being more personal with each other. Notice how in the dinner scene she is the one to introduce them by name. All making the climax tense and difficult.Mills is the kind of guy to pull his gun out before his torch. He has an arrogant sense of things though is 'by the book' and works. Somerset has never even fired his weapon. He sees the evil round him. And he wants to leave it. Though he is a cop so he has the permission to do something about it. But the problem is, he isn't doing anything about it. John Doe is. The reason why society is evil is because we are allowed to sin. There is now nothing stopping us. It has become a common factor of life. And there should be. That is why John Doe thinks his behaviour is OK. But the problem is he is being stopped instead of the crime out there. This is the harsh reality we live in.There are seven deadly sins. Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Pride. Lust. Envy. Wrath. And seven ways to die.Kevin Spacey is amazing as John Doe, portraying insanity perfectly. One of the greatest supporting performances of all-time already. And he's only in it for half an hour. Brad Pitt delivers a kind of forced performance which adds to the Hollywood effect of the film though I couldn't imagine anyone else for the part. Morgan Freeman played his role with the greatest concentration. Throughout he needed a look of woe on his face. And he did just that.The writing is extraordinary. The genius, Andrew Kevin Walker took an interesting subject and created an instant classic. But most credit has to go to Fincher. Who took aspects you wouldn't even think of looking at and filming it. Together they project a deep film on our screens that no-one should miss. In one scene near the end, he makes it so when a word is spoken we cut to a character as that gives us clues to their fate. A feast for the brain. One of the most imaginative scripts of the 90s. Fincher also knows exactly how to shoot the film. Whether it be steady-cam for the slow and easy parts or the hand-held camera for the adrenalin pumping scenes.The cinematography is what makes this an excellent movie. Everything is dark. The world out there is rough, raw, grim and gritty. It does just that. The effect it makes is astounding and truly works. The sinister music that is added keeps the heart pounding throughout and keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way. As that's what the film tries to achieve. The opening credits are upon the greatest segment of film I have ever seen. The jumpiness makes you feel uneasy yet intrigued to keep watching. Every scene, due to the effort put in it, is masterful and is what makes the film a joy to watch and observe.Se7en reveals the best glimpse we have seen of the disturbing underworld. One of my favourites and always will be.10/10\n",

            "Review 20: After years of experiencing dull, formulaic, clichèd so-called thrillers, it's always satisfying when a genuinely great movie comes along. I have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'Se7en' to be such a film, with director David Fincher  after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'Alien³'  firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. It's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since I'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that I managed to get my hands on a DVD copy. And so, without further ado, I invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'Se7en' didn't disappoint.The film takes place in a dark, gritty, unnamed metropolis, where it is always raining and danger looms ominously from every alleyway. Reserved and hardened Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen it all in his lifetime, and is finally preparing to retire to the country, away from the madness of the city. His replacement, impulsive Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), has transferred here at his own request, and is eager to make his mark, even though his career choice could be harming the wellbeing of his lonely and vulnerable wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). Both detectives are soon drawn into the case of a serial killer, John Doe, who is ritualistically murdering his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. As the murders begin piling up, the two detectives' investigation becomes an obsession, and the inevitable outcome will drastically change the lives of both. Throughout the film, Brad Pitt provides most of the comic relief, none of which detracts at all from the horrors we are witnessing on screen.David Fincher has a unique visual style that is simply thrilling to watch. Despite the thematically dark tone of the story, the film itself is positively brimming with invigorating and vibrantly-contrasted colour and lighting. The graphic murder scenes appear to splash out of the screen, before our very eyes, enhancing the feelings of dread and repulsion that accompany John Doe's horrific acts of murder. The rich, highly-stylised use of colour also helps create a memorable atmosphere of sheer foreboding; the imagery is sure to stay with you for many years to come. Even as 'Se7en' abandons the gritty setting of the city for the final act  shifting the action to a starkly-lit open field beside a trail of electric power-lines  the film loses none of its potency, the isolation of the climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless and vulnerable than before.Our villain is anonymously titled John Doe, and is played with delightful creepiness by Kevin Spacey, who only agreed to the part under the condition that he remain unbilled in the promotion and opening credits of the film. Unlike your typical serial killer, John Doe is not a crazy, impulsive and stupid mad-man, but something rather more terrifying: he is intelligent, patient and methodical. In one particularly ghastly crime, he keeps a convicted drug dealer chained to his bed for an entire year, removing his hands and his tongue, and regularly paying his rent so as to not arouse any suspicions. John Doe's entire life has been dedicated to Mankind's obsession with committing sin, and, through orchestrating his crimes, he wishes to preach to the society of their transgressions. John Doe, rather uniquely, is given a large portion of the film's final half-hour, and so he becomes a character that we come to know very well, as opposed to the half-constructed serial killers who usually turn up in the final five minutes only to be shot by the hero. Spacey is very good in the role, though I can't help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had I not been familiar with much of his later film work.The most exciting scene in the film is undoubtedly the hectic foot-chase that ensues when John Doe arrives home to his apartment, only to find Detectives Somerset and Mills waiting patiently outside his door. However, the film's climax is also well worth mentioning: though many interpretations have been floating around, my view is that the final two victims are John Doe himself (\"Envy\") and David Mills (\"Wrath\"). In order to prevent himself from being labeled a hypocrite, as Mills had suggested during the car-ride, Doe allowed his own deadly sin - envy - to result in the death of Tracy, and so enticed Mills to shoot him, simultaneously becoming the sixth victim and prompting Mills to commit the seventh sin. Some have argued that, since Mills didn't die, he can't be perceived as one of Doe's victims, but is being left alive in these circumstances perhaps even a more diabolical punishment?\n",

            "Review 21: Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a wearied homicide detective. Mills (Brad Pitt) worked hard to transfer to the troubled precinct. He's married to Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). There is a serial killer on the loose delivering his sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Somerset is tired of the city. Mills is eager to investigate.Director David Fincher has filled with beautiful darkness. It's more than just the gruesome murders. It's the rain, the music score and the grungy setting. Fincher has weaved together an artistic masterpiece. Freeman is the perfect grizzled veteran. Brad Pitt is a terrific eager newcomer. There are surprising comedy sprinkled in. The final twist is simply cinematic history. The big line is awesome. Pitt delivers it perfectly with so much heart aching pleading.

            "Review 22: Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence – no spoilers here!) is a cliché pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror. Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!\n",

            "Review 23: Remember the Silence of the Lambs which is regarded as the greatest Crime/Thriller film of all time. Well, Fincher's Se7en can rival that masterpiece.Se7en contains everything that a film should contain. It has a superbly created soundtrack by Howard Shore who rightfully, deserved an Oscar for this work. The correct casting is given for Dt. Somerset as Morgan Freeman and Dt. Mills as Brad Pitt. This really begun Pitt's career as a great actor. The two, on screen, share incredible chemistry that automatically bonds them together well. The story itself is remarkable and easy to follow. It follows the story of a serial killer who uses the Seven Deadly Sins to kill seven of his enemies in order to complete his masterpiece and in order for the world to remember and respect the seven sins. The film has that mysterious tone to it and gives certain creeps. The characters in this film are quite memorable and they themselves boost the film. The acting in the film is just sensational, the directing and pacing is just brilliant and there really wasn't a slow part of the film. All characters were enjoyable and so, the film seemed more enjoyable. Kevin Spacey did a fantastic job at playing John Doe. The first time we see John Doe as he shoots the detectives, we don't believe him as such a threat but later on in the film, as he reveals himself to the detectives, we understand the mastermind he really is. This character, more and more, reminds me of Hannibal Lecter. The ending contains such a brilliant turn of events that the film itself becomes better.****SPOILER****When Somerset warns Mills not to shoot John Doe due to his outrage at John killing his wife due to the sin 'Envy' and Mills himself finishes John's mastermind, and therefore John wins, as Mills commits the seventh and final sin, Wrath at losing his beloved. ***END OF SPOILER***Therefore, comes the end of my review to one of the greatest movies ever made...PERIOD!\n",

            "Review 24: David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart.\n",

            "Review 25: The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.Score 10/10\n",

            "Definitely a must-see Disney film for the whole family. Should create an interest for kids to learn about the actual events if they are so inclined. As entertainment, it's top-grade Disney with a hauntingly beautiful score that would fit well into any Broadway musical. The songs are splendid: 'Just Around the Riverbend', 'Colors of the Wind', 'The Virginia Company' -- and the artwork combined with the music for the gold-digging number is outstanding. Belongs up there with 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Hunchback of Notre Dame' as one a serious film fan should not miss.\n",

            "Review 2: Why on earth is this movie rated so low? It's even rated lower than some of the DTV sequels. That shouldn't happen. It is historically inaccurate, but why should that be an issue? All I want is a visually stunning film with great music, and that's what I got. The animation is splendid. America looked so rich in colour, and the colours were so bright. The songs are sometimes the weakest element of an animation. Here it is the main reason why this movie is so memorable. \"Colours of the Wind\" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard, and I've sung it before. Pocahontas's singing voice is none other than the Broadway singer, Judy Kuhn, who was absolutely terrific. When I was 12, I tried to sound like her. The incidental music is also definitely the most lyrical of the Alan Menken scores. The weakest element of the film, is actually the character development. The protagonist, voiced by Irene Bedard, is very well done, but most of the other characters are not as effective. Mel Gibson has a singing voice, but his speaking voice is too monotonous to my liking, and Ratcliffe isn't a very likable or memorable villain at all(one of Disney's blandest villains actually), despite enthusiastic voice work from David Ogden Stiers. But Meeko and Flit are great fun, and Grandmother Willow was good too. Don't say this film is racist. Some of the imagery is fantastic in the songs of war and animosity, and the film has a great love story and message. The ending was actually quite effective and poignant. In conclusion, one of the least memorable of the Disney movies, is so worth watching. 8.5/10. Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 3: During the famed \"Disney Renaissance\", a period that started in 1989 with the release of The Little Mermaid and continued through the entire 1990s, Disney was creating modern classics with every film they released. In the midst of this revolution came Pocahontas, a rousing animated musical, directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg. Pocahontas is something of an outlier in the Disney cannon. It is not a cutesy, kid-centric fairy tale a la Disney classics like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or Beauty and the Beast. What Disney's 33rd animated feature is, is a sensational movie musical, and one of Disney's most technically accomplished works.Pocahontas, in typical Disney style, takes a well-known tale and molds it into an easy-to-digest story set to music. In this case, for the first time at Disney, the story is not entirely fictional. Here's where some people come down on Pocahontas. No, it didn't stay completely true to what really happened with John Smith and the real story of Pocahontas, but it would be a much lesser movie if it had. Pocahontas, the movie, is based on the legend of Pocahontas rather than the reality. The decision to romanticize the legend is a no-brainer. This is Disney after all. We expect strong archetypes and accessible drama.The story begins with English settlers setting off for Virginia. Their leader, Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) comes in search of gold, John Smith (Mel Gibson) comes for the adventure of a lifetime. Back on the New World is Pocahontas, a young Algonquin princess voiced by Irene Bedard, who is set to be married to the tribe's dashing bachelor, Kocoum. It's all very predictable Disney stuff. The settlers are mostly just boisterous, gold-lusting, brutes, The princess is weary of getting together with the jock character, and there's only one man who understands her. We've heard it before. Even so, the story is handled with care and the familiar elements are welcome for the most part. The unfamiliar elements, chief of which is a surprisingly mature and complex love story between John Smith and Pocahontas, are where Pocahontas' plot stands out from its Disney siblings. There is more to this film than surface layer romance. Complimenting the dramatic story of betrayal and acceptance is a poignant message about coexisting peacefully with each other and the world around us.The story is as moving as any other Disney classic, but what makes Pocahontas a notable Disney Renaissance landmark is its animation and music. Hand drawn animation had been around for a half century before Pocahontas, and stage musicals a hundred years before that. It's a wonder then, that somehow Pocahontas still manages to be a jaw-dropping example of both. I don't think the film gets the credit it deserves as one of Disney's best drawn films. The animators, led by the legendary Glen Keane, do things with animation that were game-changing, even by the high standard set by the world's leading animation studio. The character designs are expertly idealized, accentuating facial features and movement without ever crossing the line into cartoon. The backgrounds are even better. The untouched beauty of the American landscape is given scale, depth, and an expressionistic dynamism. It all comes together in the musical numbers. Music is always a matter of taste, but for me, every song down the line in Pocahontas worked in a big way. I honestly cannot think of another musical that can make that claim. Every musical, animated or otherwise, has at least one dud. It's a rule. Pocahontas breaks tradition. The rhythmic \"Just Around the Riverbend\", the wonderfully wicked \"Mine, Mine, Mine\", and the grand, Oscar-winning spectacle that is \"Colors of the Wind\" are all rousing, bombastic, and sweeping pieces of music. The songs are up to the quality of the very best Broadway musicals, and the animation only improves the numbers. The explosively vivid colors and spacious movement that go along with the songs are artistry of the highest kind.There is a surplus of talent and passion in every fiber of Pocahontas. When all the pieces come together, the story, the animation, and the music, Pocahontas is remarkable. It's a film of craftsmanship and quality. While kids will no doubt enjoy it, it's not made \"for\" kids. Like the best Disney movies, Pocahontas appeals to anyone who loves music and appreciates the warm touch of hand drawn animation. Add to the sights and sounds, some of which were enough to literally take my breath away from me, a timeless message of acceptance and stewardship of nature, and what you get is a classic, Disney or otherwise. Show this movie to your kids, watch it yourself, just see it. Pocahontas is in a word... Beautiful.92/100\n",

            "Review 4: We must start with the foundation statement that this is not an historical retelling of the story of early America. We don't know what went on at that time, so we are off the mark at the beginning. Can you imagine the dark times that were involved in this era, with a group of settlers trying to establish some kind of community, and a Native American presence confused and afraid what was going on. So what Disney did was turn this into a folk tale which oral traditions have been doing forever (e.g. Paul Bunyan or John Henry or, more appropriately, Davey Crockett). I mean they sing and talk to trees. The romance had to be very strained. Throw in the search for gold and the greed, and you have a classic love in the face of barriers story. Also, there are a couple of terrific songs in this film. No, it's not \"The Lion King\" but many very good films are not \"The Godfather\" either. It doesn't mean they can't stand on their own.\n",

            "Review 5: I haven't watched Pocahontas in maybe ten years, but I was feeling nostalgic one day and popped it in. I could not believe how truly BEAUTIFUL this movie is, in every aspect. MUSIC: Aside from the songs everyone knows (Just Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind) every single other song in the film is wonderful, with soaring harmonies and Broadway quality singing. Everything was masterfully written and executed. The music alone is reason enough for this to be adapted into a full out Broadway musical, but don't worry...the music is brilliant but it doesn't scream \"MUSICAL!\" like Hairspray or Mamma Mia.ANIMATION: Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. Every single frame is such wonderful eye candy, and the camera work serves the sweeping storyline extremely well.STORY: Dramatic (with it's humorous moments of course), romantic, and it carries a very important message of peace, maturity, and fighting against ignorance and prejudice from BOTH sides. This is possibly the Disney movie with the greatest message for kids.HISTORIC ACCURACY: Yes, Disney changed the true story quite a bit, but if you look to Disney for accurate re-tellings of historical events you have a serious PROBLEM. This movie is more 'Inspired by' than 'Based on' and since the true story is about a 13-14 year old falling in love with 30-40 year I think we can all appreciate that they took some liberties with a KIDS' MOVIE.All in all, I really don't get why this isn't revered as a classic right along with The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.\n",

It does romanticise the tale of Pocahontas, and she is tied very much to the land and her people, and has a heroine's role at the end, as supposed to just being a Princess looking for Mr Right.She does of course meet a man at the end, but it's not your typical Disney ending. Much like Mulan, this was a period when the role of Disney Princess was changing.It's worth mentioning the animation, it is fantastic with the shape and movements of the key human characters, absolutely flawless.\n",

            "Review 7: When this movie came out (in 1995), I thought : \"Another one \"big stupid kiddy Disney American colonialist propaganda movie\" ! Nobody thinks no more about a love story between an Indian girl and a colonialist ! The indians were exterminated by the colonialists ! Not loved by them ! Everybody knows that !\"And I didn't watch such of silly movie, of course ! I'm not a stupid man !BUT, there's a week ago, the daughter of my sister (9 years old), forgot that DVD in my home. I thought : \"Let's see this stupidity, just to laugh at the most ridiculous Disney's movie !\"I watched it. And I cryed. This is the best Disney's movie, and maybe the best movie, I've ever watched !How can you criticize it ? Have you lost your children soul ?!!Of course, just after watched it, I thought : \"Well, that's good. Better than I thought. But that's all\".But the next day, the song of the old \"mother witch\" remains in my mind ! I decided to watch it again, and again. Now, I've seen this movie about 20 times in one week. That's incredible, I think I'm a fan !!!!For me, in general, the worst part of a Disney movie, was the songs. I've always hated them. For the first time, I found the songs were the best part of this movie ! I listened to every songs of this movie, and I think, they are all good, and even, great ! Also the music ! It's an Mozart's opera !Graphics are good, but the editing is better ! The first encounter between Pocahontas and Smith at the falls is a pure master-piece ! And the movie's references are plenty ! The \"3-voices song\" of \"savages\", reminds me the \"rumbles\" of \"West Side Story\", and the final \"goodbye\" reminds me the final of Spielberg's \"E.T.\".I don't know if this movie was done \"for children\", but I know I cry every time I watch it ! Thanks for Mike Gabriel, Eric Goldberg, Alan Menken, Stephen Schwartz, and the Disney Company to have kept their \"children soul\". I was wrong and they were right. And I'm happy of that.Well, I quit you now, I need to watch this movie again... Goodbye ! :-))10/10 !!!!!! of course !\n",

            "Review 8: The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda different than any other Disney-princess movie. The storyline was very well written, it was something new! The characters were very interesting, well-developed and some of them were really likeable (especially, Pocahontas!). The effects of the movie were nice, it was a well edited movie. Gladly, it was the first movie that included an interracial couple. The love story between, Pocahontas and John Smith was very well-developed and they were meant to be together..! I have to admit, that the soundtrack of the movie was really good. The opening scene of the movie was kinda intense. The ending scene was expected and it was very emotional. By the way, I would definitely watch a live action adaption of the movie.\n",

            "Review 9: I read the poster's comments (the one from Paris) and had to laugh, because I completely understand him. I went away for school in Europe in '95 when the film came out, and when I came back Pocahontas was the rage. You know, the way all Disney films were back then-there were commercials, songs on the radio, stuffed animals, etc....until the NEXT Disney movie came to dwarf it until a lame sequel or TV series came out. So let me tell you, I was skeptical about Pocahontas. I saw this a year after it came out and instantly fell in love with it. It's a mature Disney animated feature- (in my opinion) even more mature than Japanime films I have seen. The love story seems very real-there is a sort of chemistry between the leads that you can feel.The soundtrack is one of my favourite parts about the movie. Every song matches perfectly with the spirit of the time and place..a new world in the 1600's.Finally..whoever had the idea to cast Mel Gibson(and Christian Bale) is a genius. Love those voices!One aspect of this movie often overlooked is its dreamy editing. It is so consistent throughout and rivals many critically acclaimed films with great editing.See it again, and remember: \"You can own the earth and still, all you'll own is Earth until you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\"\n",

            "Review 10: Disney studios had hit the jackpot during the \"renaissance\" with The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Beauty and the Beast was the first animated film to ever receive a best picture nomination during the Oscar season. They wanted to hit it out of the ball park again with Pocahontas. This is where Disney was starting to slide down a little bit again. Not to put this film down because it was wonderful, but there wasn't that special little spice that made the film a huge success like it's predecessors. The animation was just spectacular, the story(despite not being at all true to the story) was very good and the songs were beautiful. But why wasn't this the major hit Disney was looking forward too? I have several theories that I'll explain in just a moment.British settlers of the Virginia Company sets sail to the \"New World\". Onboard the ship are Captain John Smith and the voyage's leader Governor Ratcliffe, who believes the local Native Americans are hiding a vast collection of gold and seeks to gain it for his own. In the local tribe in the New World, Pocahontas, daughter of Chief Powhatan, dreads being possibly wed to Kocoum, a brave warrior whom she sees as too \"serious\" when conflicting with her spirited personality. Pocahontas, along with her friends, the raccoon Meeko and hummingbird Flit, visit Grandmother Willow, a spiritual talking willow tree who alerts her to the presence of the Englishmen. She meets John Smith and shows him the \"New World\" as he realizes the peace and love the tribe brings, they both try to bring a bond between their groups, but it might be more difficult than they realize.Why this film wasn't as big a smash as the studios wanted I think was due to the way the story was told. First off, I know that for Hollywood to keep the audience's interest they do need to have their own little twist on history, but why not keep more true to the story of Pocahontas? I suppose because her story wasn't enough to keep the kid's interest just like how they \"sexified\" her up. Although why does her nose look like Lord Voldemort? Seriously, can she breathe out of that thing? There is a massive stare fest between her and John Smith that felt more awkward than beautiful and romantic. There's also a lot of standing majestically which I thought made the characters look more like mannequins.However, I still like Pocahontas a lot. It's not the Disney movie I watch more than a few times, but the animation is just absolutely stunning, some of Disney's best. The songs like \"Colors of the wind\" and \"Drums of War\" were great. Even the side animal characters were really funny and cute. I would still recommend Pocahontas, not just for die hard fans of Disney, but it's a terrific family film that I'm sure anyone could enjoy as long as you don't take it seriously like some other crazy people have, it's a movie! People need to check the size of their underwear, it may be time for a bigger size.7/10\n",

            "Review 11: 'Pocahontas' is certainly not among the best films to come out of Disney but in my humble opinion it deserves more than 5.7. I found it to be very charming, with wonderful characters, fantastic animation, stunning visuals, sweet chemistry between the lovers, lovely songs (Colours of the Wind is breathtaking), and simple Disney entertainment. I liked the way it ended, somewhat differently from other Disney films.My only complaint is that I didn't like it when one of the Indians got killed and how Pocahontas was more concerned about never seeing John. Also the father forgiving John immediately was unrealistic. More character development was required for us to at least understand the father's character. The dialogues were a little clichéd. It was also strange to see Pocahontas communicating with John in English.Having read about 'Pocahontas' I found it very unfair that it was labelled a racist film. Where was the racism? If anything, it's about bringing people together. It's about unconditional love that can exist both within and between races. I also think it was very unfair that the film was trashed for not being historically accurate. Come on, it's a Disney film for kids not some kind of epic film. Perhaps the unconventional ending (quite non-Disney) was too much to take for some people.However, except for the flaws I mentioned, I think it's a great film and one can really enjoy it especially because of the visual beauty and the beautiful songs and I loved the characters Percy, Meeko and Flit. They provided some memorable comic relief.\n",

            "Review 12: This is by far the most under-rated Disney movie of all time. Sure it wasn't perfect, but it is MUCH better than a 5.6.The story is absolutely engrossing. There are so many good and realistic things going on... a man learning about all the little things he has missed in life, an Indian princess striving for adventure and guidance amongst her steady and safe society, and a full-blown war between civilizations who both believe that the other is made of savages. I appreciate that this story is a realistic depiction of war, with two disagreeing sides, neither of which is necessarily right or wrong.The animation in this movie is absolutely spectacular. And it is spectacular in the best way: with a basis in cinematography. The animation is not only spectacular because of the details in the backgrounds and the characters, but even more so because of how beautifully it is used. Scenes such as when Pocahontas and John meet in the mist are the kind of simple beauty that more movies need. When you hear the song \"Listen With Your Heart\", you can practically feel the breath of the surrounding forest. Fantastic stuff.Another big high point is the music. Everyone's heard the show-stopping \"Colors of the Wind\", but the others are worthy of praise as well. \"Steady as the Beating Drum\", \"Just Around the River Bend\", \"Savages\", \"Listen With Your Heart\", \"Mine, Mine, Mine\", and the deleted \"If I Never Knew You\" ALL fit perfectly. Musically, this movie is on par with Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and just a tick behind \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Lion King\".So if all these things are good, why only an 8? Two words... the ending. Everything leading up to it is so engrossing, and \"Savages\" builds up such an intense conflict drama, and everything is falling apart. This was the chance for Disney to turn this movie into a classic, and with what had to happen, they easily could have. But they completely failed. After \"Savages\", the scene that should have been the most intense and dramatic climax in their history ended almost instantly. It was too fast, there was almost no drama like their should have been, and the dialog was awful... captured none of the epic feel that it should have. Such a shame that such a great film was wrecked by such a horribly executed ending.I also wasn't a fan of the constant distractions of the animal sidekicks, and of course there are the matters of historical accuracy and non-stereotypical depiction of the Indians, but as an avid animation fan I was willing to overlook these issues and give it a chance to be a good film in a non-contexted world. Some may be put off by this, but since when have animated films been historically accurate? So, honestly, those who are put off by things like \"People in the dynasty when Mulan lived weren't praying to ancestors yet\" should probably not expect to like this movie.Out-of-context, I give it an 8/10 because everything up till the ending was completely magical, and had some of the best moments in all of Disney history, but the ending fell flat. I still want to watch it over and over again, because the rest of the movie really was fantastic. With a proper dramatic ending, I really do think that it could have been nominated for \"Best Picture\" like the Disney people thought it would. As is, it's a great entry into the animated classics canon. Definitely recommended even though it falls well short of the greatness achieved by the early 90's films.\n",

The years have passed, and I'm 19, and I felt really stupid because I didn't like this movie. Oh my god. This movie wasn't made for children, It was made for grow ups. It's language... a child would never understand the message. A child would just enjoy the animation, Meeko and the songs. When I saw that movie again, 2 years ago, I understood why they couldn't be together, I understood the message of the songs and I understood the fact that this movie is one of the most brilliants animations crated. When I saw \"Colors of the wind\" I cried. When I heard \"Savages!\" I got chills. How Disney did that? Kids, don't watch this movie. Grow-ups, GO NOW AND WATCH.

I know many have complained that the movie is a European version of an event and demeaning to American Indians, but from what I've read, Russel Means (voice of Powhatan) was happy with the final product and its portrayal of Native Americans.

But now, almost ten years later I saw it again, and wow what a surprise I got... The movie is probably the only Disney movie with a REAL love story, the sneak around and tries to hide their love, and in the incredibly sad ending, they choose life over love (or something like that), which makes the whole thing mature and realistic. And the music, that wonderful music. \"Colors of the wind\" (fantastic singing by musical star Judy Kuhn) is probably one of the best Disney songs of all time. The other songs are great too. The only thing the film lacks is \"classic\" animation, these new things like; not seeing Pocahontas nose from the front, I dunno, I can't help thinking of this film with the animators (and style) from \"The beauty and the beast\". The voice acting is top notch by the way!

            "Review 16: To all the haters who criticize this movie for being inaccurate. If you want the facts, watch the documentary or read history books. 'Pocahontas' got the inspiration from historical figures but the movie is made with imagination and creativity, telling the love story and morals that the difference does not define the inferiority. The producers or the director never claims that 'Pocahontas' is based on what really happened to Pocahontas or Rebecca Rolfe.I praise that it is made with such respect toward nature and the natives. Nature is beautifully portrayed with surprising animation quality, and it is a pleasure to watch long shots with lots of greenery. It personifies the tree as a Grandmother Willow who gives wise guidance. The director compares Pocahontas' life to nature such as river, wind, or tree. Life can be unknown and different from different angles like river. Life takes people to right places and flows like wind. Life is grounded deeply and connected to each other like trees.This movie also does justice to Native Americans. It questions how they are described in the literature or in the history. They have been called savages just because they are different, and not many movie states that they were the victims of conquerors. It also brings light to the economic difficulties and infringe on their rights at present time.This film is so much more than a love story. It contains deeper message and philosophy of how we look at the nature and the differences in the society.P. S I LOVE the fact that Pocahontas choses to stay for her people instead of leaving with her love. The ending is more realistic, dramatic, and powerful.\n",

            "Review 19: For as much bad press as Pocahontas got, I must say I really disagree with the people who call it flat and lifeless. I thought that after the exclusively tan Lion King, the fresh blues and greens of the foggy Virginia woods were quite beautiful to behold. No one can deny that this is a very beautiful movie, almost exquisite in its animation. Although John Smith is nowhere near as handsome as he thinks he is and peoples' eyes have a strange tendency to all but disappear at times (Look at Smith, Nakoma and Kokoum to see what I mean), it is very very pretty.Unfortunately, if they'd just waited a year or so after The Lion King, I think it would have gotten much better ratings. As I see it, it is a very interesting story, if a bit tired at times. Pocahontas is a fine heroine, she's very courageous and likeable, and unlike Jasmine and Nala from the previous two Disney films, she's much more than just a pretty face. The love story with Captain Smith is actually done rather well despite the fact that I really disliked the Smith character. I'm not sure why they made him so flat and one-dimensional in contrast to Pocahontas' rich personality, but I didn't find him at all interesting. The cute animal mascots were allright, if totally out of place in the otherwise dark world. They would be funny to little kids, but they're pretty annoying to a mature viewer. I didn't really care for Chief Powhatan, he was a little too dense considering the circumstances. I'd say my favorite characters were Nakoma, Pocahontas' best friend and Kokoum, the personality-less warrior. At least those two had some decent tension. I also really enjoyed David Ogden Stiers' duel performance as Governor Ratcliffe and his cute little yes-man, Wiggins. Those two characters truthfully provided the best entertainment of the film, and it might have been a better movie if they'd replaced some of the preachiness with more entertaining scenes of those two plotting.\n",

            "Review 20: Disney take on the story of Pocahontas and John Smith. I just saw this for the first time since its initial release. My feelings back then were somewhat lukewarm but, to put that in context, my tastes were more narrow then and I was not really into Disney or anything that felt even slightly like a 'chick flick.' Now I'm happy to say I recognize what an enjoyable film this is. The animation is wonderful with so much beautiful imagery that it took me by surprise because I didn't remember that from my first viewing. The scene where John Smith first sees Pocahontas will take your breath away. The movie makes excellent use of lush colors. Some scenes are saturated with purples and blues -- it's really stunning. Pocahontas herself is gorgeously drawn. She's easily one of the most striking Disney Princesses ever. The score is evocative and lovely with one great song (\"Colors of the Wind\") and some other forgettable ones. The voice work is wonderful, especially Irene Bedard in the lead. There are nice touches of humor throughout with a talking tree and playful animals that seem to have stepped right out of Bambi's forest. The emotional stuff is where the movie really knocks it out of the park, whether it be the romance between Pocahontas and Smith or little brilliant scenes such as when Powhatan feels his wife's spirit in the wind.The cause for much criticism and complaints about the film come, of course, from the history police. The movie is historically inaccurate, which should come as no surprise to anyone over the age of four. I'm never one to get all that worked up about historical accuracy in movies (let alone cartoons) anyway. You want to be entertained, watch this movie. You want to learn more about history, open a book. One charming reviewer here said the movie was guilty of whitewashing genocide. What a shocker that Disney didn't want to make an animated version of Soldier Blue! Look, it's a cartoon loosely based on people who lived and died 400 years ago. Unclench your fists, take a breath, and stop relying on Hollywood to educate your children and getting ticked off when they don't do it the way you want them to. It's a good animated film and I think everyone who isn't looking to get angry about as many things as they can before they die should see it.\n",

Pocahontas is the daughter of a chief who wishes to find her path in life. She feels it her duty to keep peace between her own people and the intruding British who are hoping to find gold as did the early Spanish explorers. She finds herself falling in love with one of these new visitors and uses this relationship in attempting to prevent a potential war. But can she stop the greedy settlers from their determination to find Gold, and can she convince her Father that they should try to live in peace with their new neighbors? You may be pleasantly surprised. Between the music and the animation Pocahontas is a classic Disney film that should be included in every video collection. Just don't expect to learn any hidden truths about American history. Take it for what it is.\n",

            "Review 22: I am an American History teacher and this is the sort of film that causes people like me to grumble and complain because the film bears almost no similarity to the actual story of the founding of the Jamestown colony. But, it is because of this and how widely the movie was loved and accepted that I actually use it in my class discussions--teaching kids that much of our history is distorted or even completely fictional. Like George Washington's \"wooden teeth\", the \"fact\" that everyone in Columbus' day thought the Earth was flat and Betsy Ross making the very first American flag (all fiction, by the way), this film is a great example of bad history. Now understand, I am NOT an America-basher or live to destroy our national heroes--I just don't like it when something sacred like our history is treated with such blatant disrespect and cynicism.While my list would be HUGE, here are a few of the problems with the story: the girl's name was \"Matoaka\" not \"Pocahontas\" (this was a nickname, not her real name), she was about 11 or so and Smith an older man and so the romance in the Disney film is either disgusting or false (fortunately, there was no romance according to all but the Disney account), the whole head getting smashed like a pumpkin incident probably never occurred (Smith spoke of this for the first time 17 years after the fact and it was never recorded elsewhere before this--plus Matoaka publicly showed contempt for Smith--something that makes no sense if the story was true), Matoaka was kidnapped by the British and she did not willingly join them (as seen in POCAHONTAS II), and the natives were not \"tree-hugging hippies\"--but real 3-dimensional people (for good and bad).If you can ignore all this, you are left with a heavy-handed and preachy film with a lot of New Age mumbo-jumbo about nature and talking trees and all that crap. Pleasant to the eye--but about as deep as Paris Hilton's personality. Bland and only mildly entertaining---and guaranteed to tick off anyone who cares in the least about the truth.\n",

            "Review 23: WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.Out of every film that has ever been labeled Walt Disney \"classic\" or \"masterpiece\", this is the lowest rated one with a 5.9 rating, why? People think it's degrading and offensive to Native Americans, no, seriously, that's why this gem is so hated.Okay, people, it's a Walt Disney movie; Did you honestly think it was going to be 100% accurate and meant to reach out to full grown adults? Actually, it's not degrading or offensive one bit. It's actually really beautiful and touching. The song \"Colors of the Wind\" is one of the most beautiful and heartfelt songs that has ever been released in a Disney movie. The characters are top notch and the, what most think is crappy, animation, I think, is wonderful! Some things like Grandmother Willow telling her to follow her heart and that Pocahontas is able to overcome the barriers of race to find love are such powerful messages that were so great seeing in this.As one comment says, \"When Pocahontas originally came out, Disney's wave of recent hits came to a crashing halt. The film was labeled as racist or at least insensitive to Native Americans and the goodwill that Disney had established with its audiences quickly evaporated. You could say they have never been the same since\", which is very disappointing because this movie was not a scratch on Walt Disney's film records like most people think.I always love seeing Pocahontas rush to save the day and prove that any \"savage\"'s violence and carnage, whether Native American or not, can be halted by the powers of love. While this film gets a very bad wrap, it's not anywhere near as horrible as everyone lets on. With beautiful songs, great animation and wonderful, powerful messages one after another, Pocahontas is Disney's most underrated and under-appreciated masterpiece by far. I always enjoy watching it and find myself getting chills at many of scenes; I have chills all through \"Colors of the Wind\", when she is running to stop the war and the final scene when she is standing on the rock and the leaves brush past her in the wind.Beautiful movie, a shame it wasn't considered a hit like most, and just overall gets very unfair treatment. Though it's no The Lion King, Aladdin or the numerous Disney classics before the 90's, it deserves just as much positive recognition which, like I've stated many times, it fails to get. I love it, and people who hate it need to open their eyes and see it for what a beautifully crafted and heartfelt story it really is...P.S. The extra song sang by Pocahontas and John Smith on the 10th anniversary DVD is too die for...\n",

            "Review 24: I can't believe how many negative reviews this film has received. In reality, everything about the film is masterfully done. The animation is beautifully drawn and the characters are all full of life. For some reason, people feel that the film is racist, but on the contrary, it teaches that we need not look upon others as inferior or unimportant but that we should all live together and share the land. One of the things that really impressed me about this movie was the music. Although \"Colors of the Wind\" won the Oscar, \"If I Never Knew You\" is even better, in my opinion. Nevertheless, these are two of the best songs I've ever heard in a Disney movie. The interactions between the characters are perfectly done. Without giving away the ending, the film doesn't end perfectly happy, unlike most Disney films. Not that I don't love happy endings, but this keeps the reality of the story of Pocahontas more accurate, and Disney should be applauded for that. Maybe not everything is perfect about the movie, but it satisfied me and proved to be enjoyable and filled with emotion. If you've put off seeing this film, don't deprive yourself any longer. It's worth your time.***1/2 out of ****\n",

            "Review 25: Pocahontas is a spectacular animated film with an excellent script, very well built characters, an endearing villain, excellent songs, and beautiful animation. Of course it's different from the real Pocahontas story, but the movie is rather an inspiration in which Disney adapted the story in its own way, as always in most of its classics. The romance between Pocahontas and John Smith is undoubtedly the heart and soul of this work, offering a moving story. Their relationship makes the audience feel the movie's charm. A respectable animated work in the Disney filmography. My rating for this movie is a 10/10.\n",

            "Review 1: One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: \"the movies of the nineties\" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is \"Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). For others it will be \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) while others will praise to the skies \"Se7en\" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, \"the Usual Suspects\" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches \"the Usual Suspects\" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch \"the Usual Suspects\" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this \"coup de theatre\" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, \"the Usual Suspects\" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...\n",

            "Review 2: I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a \"gimp.\" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying.\n",

            "Review 3: 'The Usual Suspects' has received a lot of comment for its killer twist ending, which while by no means the first in movie history, has proved to be enormously influential (stand up Messrs. Fincher and Shyamalan...). But this movie is so much more than a surprise ending! It is a meticulously scripted, faultlessly acted masterpiece that stands up to repeated viewings. Every single time I watch it I notice some new detail, or get more enjoyment out of a performance or scene. This movie really put  Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the ensemble cast is outstanding, even Stephen Baldwin(!), who has never appeared in a movie this good before, or since.  I also got a kick out of the Paul Bartel ( 'Death Race 2000', 'Eating Raoul') cameo, and the ultra-cool Peter Greene's ('Laws Of Gravity', 'Pulp Fiction') all too brief appearance. Bartel is sorely missed, and Greene one day (mark my words!) will become the star he deserves to be.Director Bryan Singer has yet to live up to the promise shown here with his subsequent movies, the average 'Apt Pupil' and the disappointing 'X-Men'. For all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the real star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational script, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved it's Oscar.It really doesn't get any better than this!! One of the greatest movies ever made, any time, any where. A truly unforgettable experience.\n",

            "Review 4: Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called \" The Usual Suspects\" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 5: The Usual Suspects only works because of its infamous twist ending. Until then, it is simply a convoluted mess that does not offer any ways to resolve its twisting and unreliable plot threads. Films with plot twists work well if they are enjoyable up until the revelation, like The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Prestige (2006). They offer enough mystery to tease a potential revelation and enough clues to figure it out. The Usual Suspects, however, revels in sheer incomprehensibility and hollowness that necessarily demands an explanation to appreciate even at a basic level. Even afterwards, the revelation clearly exists more for the audience's emotional reaction rather than making any sense within the scenario of the film. Gimmicky storytelling aside, the acting, production values and sense of suspense were all handled quite well for a low budget film.\n",

            "Review 6: Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an \"epic,\" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 7: \"The Usual Suspects\" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't watch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes \"The Usual Suspects\" work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in \"The Godfather, Part II\".  5 stars out of 5.\n",

            "Review 8: Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.\n",

Had fantastic dialogue, great acting, but most importantly the plot is so unique and the final twists and turns are brilliant. Modern day films just don't have this kind of uniqueness anymore sadly and this is why I have been watching older films as of late.My only criticism is that I thought the first half an hour was really slow. The movie had no real direction and I was genuinely pretty bored. However, once it kicks into gear I was sat on the edge of my seat. I mentioned in the title the ending, this genuinely has to be one of the best endings to a movie I've ever seen. The twists and turns in the final 15 mins or so was amazing! I was gobsmacked. And very few films have ever managed to pull that off.I don't have much else to really say other than it's a great movie and deserves the credit it's had over the last 22 years or so! Must watch if you haven't already.\n",

            "Review 10: The Usual Suspects is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor - leaving few survivors.It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him.We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10\n",

This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-\n",

The crew meets at a sketchy line up after a truck robbery. They start working together until they are contacted by the mysterious Keyser Söze.This is densely packed crime drama. For most of this, the audience is working hard to keep up with the characters and the story. It all makes sense but every once in a while, something sounds suspicious. When I first saw it in the theater, more than once it left me scratching my head. Then the twist comes, blows my mind, and explains all the suspicions I had.The five men crew is played expertly by Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, and Stephen Baldwin.

Just when you think you know all, they pull the rug from under you, and make you think again. Direction is taut, the script is impressive.I would argue this is one of Spacey's best ever performances, if not the best of the lot, he is phenomenal here, and really does stand out in a crowd of immense talent, hopefully he'll get his career back on track.Gabriel Byrne and Pete Postlethwaite shine, as does Stephen Baldwin, a time where that handsome brotherhood seemed to pop up everywhere, but he was excellent also.It's a super slick production, with some pretty fine special effects, and good use of pyrotechnics, a polished production, one that's not overdone.This is one of those movies that you can watch and watch again, it simply doesn't diminish or lose any of its intrigue. You know there's a twist coming, you'll sit there waiting for it, and the first time round your jaw may drop, it's a very well delivered moment. The ending of this film is fabulous.10/10.\n",

            "Review 14: After a gun fight on the docks leaves only one survivor with the majority dead, NYC agent Dave Kujan flies in to ensure that ex-cop Dean Keaton is really dead.  During the questioning the survivor, Verbal Kint, tells of how events came to happen.  Five criminals are brought together in a line up and decide to use the events to plan a job.  However another survivor tells an extra story  one involving master criminal Kyser Soze.  Kint reveals how the gang were forced into the fateful job by Soze  however who is Soze and why did the men try to steal what appears to be a ship load of drugs that didn't exist?When I first saw this I saw it in the cinema  the very next day I went back and watched it again.  The plot starts with a cliff hanger and appears to gradually answer the mystery  - however what it actually does is create more questions for every answer it appears to give.  It does this without frustrating you or without confusing the issue  in fact you don't know right till the end that you've been caught in a story teller's web.  The plot unfolds like a normal thriller but it is anything but.The strength of the film is in the writing but it is the direction that also manages to create a great mood.  Singer uses clever shots weaving the story into a believable web of deceit.  The cast add quality to every single line, every single scene.  It's hard to imagine that the film could be the same with any one person changed.Bryne is great as Keaton, his world weary cop drawn into a plan he can't control  or is he the master behind it all.  Spacey gives a great performance as our eyes and ears as he retells the events, he deservedly won an Oscar for this role  before he got all soft and started becoming a starring man.  Baldwin has the film of his life (albeit not hard!), he's really good and should be lucky to get another good role.  Even the minor roles in the gang are great  Del Toro's performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way.  Likewise Pollack will never have a better role  he has genuine tension between him and Baldwin (even in later interviews the dislike still seems real  with things like Pollack telling Baldwin he's sorry that his brothers stole all the food from his table).  Palminteri does a great performance and is totally convincing.  Postlethwaite is good despite playing an Asian (?) lawyer.  Suzi Amis is good in her brief role and Esposito is as good as he always is.Overall I could talk for hours about this film.  It's rare for films now to have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it  it's still twisty and impressive no matter how many times you watch it.\n",

            "Review 15: Kaiser Soze is a super-criminal of almost comic-book stature. Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotine-driven low-life 'usual suspects' of this film - Soze - remains unseen, fantastic, just outside of the camera's view, and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless, he is the central character in the film, and the single force of will driving the entire film. The viewer, like the characters portrayed, must constantly ask 'Who is Kaiser Soze, does he even exist?\", and - as silly as it might seem - \"is he the devil himself?\". Soze's irresistible will is represented and enforced by an emissary (the stone-faced Pete Postlethwaite) who is just as cold-hearted as any of the hardened criminals who comprise 'The Usual Suspects'.The narrative begins and almost ends as a retrospective with just a bit of very necessary voice-over narrative by Spacey. His character - Verbal Kint - is interrogated by Palmintieri concerning the murder of several hardened criminals in a single night aboard Russian ship. Most of the major plot points are highlighted wonderfully by the changes of pace and camera work afforded by the shift between one plot - the events leading to Kint's interrogation - and another - the interrogation itself.Kint, physically disabled and emotionally disturbed, is himself a desperate, down-on-his luck, petty criminal whose chief talent seems to be getting mixed up with and attaching himself to more talented criminals. His latest 'friend' - Keating (Byrne) is a brilliant but depressive thief who is trying to straighten his life out for a woman lawyer he has fallen for. But along with the other 'usual suspects' - expert safe crackers, con men and sociopaths (possibly the best performance of Stephen Baldwin's career thus far) all - Keating is swept up into agreeing to do 'one final job'. In a fine piece of character interpetation, Byrne plays denial to the hilt telling himself that this job, if successful, could end his life in crime permanently. These expert thieves, con men and killers meet in a bogus police line-up one night and from that point on, they are bound together under the control of Soze until they either succeed or fail in the crime he has laid before them.Soze has been betrayed, whether directly or indirectly, by each of these men, and he leaves them all no choice. Accept the crime plan or die. They accept, knowing that their odds of success are, to say the least, very limited.The entire feeling of this film shifts radically from the action of the main plot (described in Kint's narrative) and the narrative itself (Kint's interrogation). While this may look simply like a clever piece of film work, it is actually a very brilliant plot device, as both story lines are finally united in the stunning and brilliant finish.While I am not usually a ready fan of mysteries, and even less interested in thrillers, this film was pure entertainment from start to finish.Director Singer has established himself as a pioneer in ensemble cast direction, and this film alone (his third) should have awarded him that title.The performances are, without exception, flawless. While flawlessness or some approximation of it is something I generally expect from people like Spacey, Byrne, and Del Toro, many of the folks in this film very much surprised me. I now watch out for folks like Kevin Pollak, for example. Without detracting from the performers whatsoever, some credit for the stunning quality of the performances must go to the director, editor, script and cinematography team. This film makes them all look positively great.I was bitterly disappointed by the fact that this film did not take many Academy Awards in its release year. While I realize that the academy's choices do not always reflect quality or achievement, I prefer to maintain at least a superficial guise of hopefulness. The fact that Usual Suspects did not win for editing was the biggest shock. I can not think of a better piece of editing.\n",

            "Review 16: The interrogation, the lineup, and the story telling are all intricate to this film and really is what makes this a great movie and a 90's classic.The lineup scene is iconic and absolutely a fan favourite no doubt. Each characters personality is defined in that one sentence.Kevin Spacey gives a heck of a performance and for me it's definitely his best.\n",

            "Review 17: [**Major spoilers**] This movie began on a sour note in the opening scene with a man on an upper floor pissing down onto a ribbon of flaming gasoline on a lower floor to put it out. Right off we know that there is going to have to be some major suspension of disbelief. The story line is not nearly as complicated as it is made out to be. Within the context of this movie, maybe that was a goal. I never did figure out what the deal was with the image of the rope heading into a rat's nest of junk that was shown several times.A real problem for me was that the two main thugs in this were not at all threatening. The final plot twist only furthered this dissonance - it was kind of like finding out that behind the mask of Darth Vader we find Pee-wee Herman. And I felt manipulated by the final twist (that was in fact somewhat anticipated, after all Verbal was smoking his cigarette in the Turkish style). Are we to believe that Verbal boarded the boat and changed into a fedora and black overcoat to perform the crucial murder? What was the point of that besides trying to fool the audience? And so many times in the exchanges between Verbal and Kujan, I felt I was watching actors rather than characters.The bottom line on this movie is that it is no more than a tricked out episode of \"Law and Order\" without offering anything substantial to think about after it's over.\n",

            "Review 18: The Usual Suspects is two movies in one.  Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round.  The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer.  It requires a certain amount of commitment, though.  Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.It concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea.  The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before.  That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.Gabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic.  The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man.  He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts.\n",

            "Review 19: Usual Suspects is one of the Best Mystery Thrillers in the world. It contains one of the greatest endings ever seen in any film. When i first saw this film, i understood 85% of the film. I had to watch it again, to recap on what happened earlier. After the second time i watched it, i realised this is a Superb movie with a fabulous twist. I have now seen this film about 20 times and seems to get better every time i watch it. Kevin Spacey delivers the greatest performance in his career. Gabriel is great, Benecio delivers a great performance with humour. Stephen is quite good in his best film. Pollak was impressive, Chazz Palminteri is a Superb underrated actor. Chazz looks ultimately smart and supposingly is a intelligent investigator. But Spacey turns out to be 10 steps ahead. Superb, brilliant and any other great ways to describe this film.\n",

            "Review 20: I'd heard people say what a great movie \"The Usual Suspects\" was for a long time, but never got around to watching it...until tonight. I discovered it was available to watch instant stream on Netflix and decided to go ahead and give it a go. I've got to say, I'm pretty disappointed in it.Once again, I feel I fell victim to hype. People hyped this movie up to be awesome, and I just don't think it was. In my opinion, the movie was OK at best.The performances were all good. It's just that the movie was so slow...I couldn't believe that it's running time was a slim one hour and forty-five minutes. It felt like it was about two hours and twenty minutes to me.Then, I just felt the \"big reveal\" at the end was a little hokey. I mean, if you're that great of a criminal mastermind you would've had your BS story made up long before you ever entered an interrogation room -- for Kevin Spacey's character to have supposedly come up with the details for his story based off what he'd seen on a bulletin board...I'm sorry, but I've got to cry foul! If you've already got the story made up, you're not going to need to find inspiration for names of characters off a bulletin board, but I realize if he hadn't have gotten the names off the bulletin board, the audience wouldn't have really known he was lying the whole time. I get that, but I think the ending requires too much suspension of disbelief.I'm sure most people who like this movie like it because of its ending. Maybe if you take it for what it is, at a surface level, it might work...but once you start digging a little deeper and actually think about what you've just watched...it's not that great of an ending.I'll give it some credit for trying to go a different way than most movies of its type do, but that's about all I can really give it credit for. The movie itself was just really slow and didn't really pay off in the end, in my opinion, anyway.I'd give it maybe a five out of ten. That's about all the more I think it deserves. It wasn't GREAT, it wasn't HORRIBLE...it was just OK.You can check it out if you want to, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd recommend it. Take that for what it's worth coming from an anonymous movie reviewer.\n",

            "Review 21: In the beginning of \"The Usual Suspects,\" a man is killed on the deck of a ship, and suddenly an explosion completely tears apart the docked ship. Flash forward to the next day. Dave Kujan (Chazz Palimenteri) is forcing a statement out of the only surviver of the explosion, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, in the role that made him a star). Verbal recalls the last few weeks to Dave, who listens intently.We start when five criminals are brought in for a line-up. There's McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint. While they are being held in prison, the five men all agree that the police just need someone to pin the crime they are suspected of on someone. They all agree to plan revenge by forming a league of crime...Lotta stuff happens, next we know a legendary criminal named Keizer Soze (whose name reminds me of a type of food) has the five men under his control. He makes them steal drugs off a docked ship, and as we see in the beginning, the men all die save Verbal. Hmm, who could Keizer Soze be? How did all the people die? Who is Lara Croft? Oops, wrong tagline.\"The Usual Suspects\" is a very good film, but not one of my favorites. It's extremely catchy, brutal, etc., but comes across slightly shallow. The ending, though surprising, doesn't really click together as well as some other films with surprises. I wasn't confused by the ending, I understood it, I just thought it was a bit shallow compared to some other flicks.MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!In the end we find out Kevin Spacey is Keizer Soze...I think...or is he Soze's henchman? Or is Soze just a legend? It's open to debate. But what makes it a bit more shallow from other films is that Verbal Kint is the one who tells this long story to Dave Kujan, and assumably he made most of it up because he was the criminal all along and had to cover himself up...so there's no real \"wow!\" element. If Verbal made up the story and turns out to be the man behind the killings, well, it's just a bit shallow as compared to some other films. We are expected to be amazed that he is Soze, but if the tale he told Kujan and us was for the most part a lie, then the fact that he was Soze all along isn't quite as amazing...umm...do you understand what I'm saying?But I'm not saying I dislike this movie. In fact, that's far from it. I really enjoyed this flick. It's terrific. Great performances by the entire cast, especially Spacey, who won an Oscar for his role. Even Stephen Baldwin was good in this movie!\"The Usual Suspects\" is a lot like \"Basic,\" a film starring John Travolta. There are a lot of plot twists, but the duration of the film is a bunch of lies, and many of the \"twists\" don't make sense, and are there simply to confuse the audience into thinking something else. Behind all the gloss there isn't a whole lot there. But \"The Usual Suspects\" is still a great film, and though the end is slightly shallow, and the duration of the film is an excuse for the ending, it's still surprising and effective. And unlike \"Basic\" which dragged on for over two hours, \"The Usual Suspects\" knows when to stop its banter and get to the point.Effective film-making, but slightly overrated and shallow.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer\n",

            "Review 22: The Usual Suspects (1995) is a move in my DVD collection that I recently watched again for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a heist that the police can't figure out what was stolen. They have dead bodies everywhere but no missing product and one arrested suspect/witness. The police interrogate the witness and hear an unbelievable tale of a drug kingpin and a band of misfits who come together to pull off a heist like the department has never heard of...This movie is directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men) and stars Kevin Spacey (House of Cards), Gabriel Byrne (End of Days), Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale), Stephen Baldwin (Fred Clause), Benicio Del Toro (Crash) and Pete Postlethwaite (The Town).The storyline and characters for this picture is brilliantly written and presented to the audience in a perfectly paced manner. The cast is well selected and everyone executed their character perfectly, especially Spacey who delivers my all time favorite performance of his. The sub plots were very well developed and presented to the audience and police officers. The interrogation scenes are so good. The soundtrack is also epic and the conclusion is cinematic gold.Overall this is a masterpiece and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.\n",

            "Review 23: After a bloodbath and fire on a moored ship only the badly burned Hngarian mobster Arkosh Kovash (Morgan Hunter) and the crippled small- time crook Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey) survive. Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser Söze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser Söze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser Söze?Twenty-two years after the releasing date, \"The Usual Suspects\" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser Söze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Os Suspeitos\"\n",

            "Review 24: Boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve near-mythological status, The Usual Suspects is known for riveting suspense and action, an intriguing plot line and a jaw- dropping twist at the end. It also features some of the most memorable lines of the 1990s: \"How do you shoot the devil in the back--what if you miss?\" The characters, Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) have real character details and cues.The film is set in the aftermath of a ship fire that totally burns the cargo and crew. Though meek and disabled, Verbal is the only survivor to walk away from the incident unscathed. He is taken into custody and grilled by the police. Brilliantly played in a characteristic, understated style that earned Spacey an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Verbal is cleared and allowed to leave. But before he can go, agent Kujan from US Customs shows up to interrogate him. Kujan is trying to build a case against Keaton and he wants Verbal to testify in exchange for immunity. Verbal refuses, but Kujan still bullies Verbal into recounting his story of Keaton, McManus, Fenster and Hockney, leading up to the explosion on the ship. What follows is a fantastic yarn of lies and half-truths sprinkled within the facts of the case. It is all masterfully portrayed as a series of flashbacks while Verbal and Kujan sip coffee and talk in the LA police station. The story begins six weeks earlier in New York City as Verbal and the other four criminals are brought in to stand side-by-side in a police lineup. None of them are formally charged with a crime, and there are indications Keaton has actually gone straight prior to the roundup. But before they are released, the five hatch a plan to get revenge on the corrupt NYPD and make a large sum of money in the process by robbing a police-protected jewel smuggler and leaking news of the police involvement to the press. Keaton is reluctant and must be coaxed into it with the promise that no one will be killed in the heist. He agrees and the quintet pulls off the robbery to perfection. The acting and writing take chances that pay off, with each actor fully immersing himself in his role. Del Toro creates a uniquely colorful persona in his portrayal of Fenster, Baldwin conveys a reckless abandon and lust for violence, Pollak shows steely courage and resolve, Byrne is a complex mesh of toughness with motives pulling him in all directions. Each actor is at the top of his game. The five criminals go to Los Angeles to lay low in the aftermath of the New York heist. There, they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed to involve no killing. Unfortunately, this LA heist goes horribly wrong. As Verbal recounts this carnage, its aftermath and the growing problems and hostility in the crew, agent Kujan receives a tip from one of his colleagues who has a survivor pulled from the water near the charred wreckage of the ship. The witness is badly burned and cannot speak English, but insists that the man responsible for the destruction of life and property on the ship is named Kaiser Soze. Whether it is attributable to lies in Verbal's yarn or odd casting decisions, several characters in The Usual Suspects add to the film's mystique. Chief among these is the Irish Postlethwaite cast as the Japanese Kobayashi. There is a strong clue at the end that the name Kobayashi is used solely to mislead Kujan. But Kobayashi is not the only instance of a character's name failing to match his appearance. Another example is McManus' contact in LA, Redfoot, which one would expect to be the name of a Native American. But Redfoot appears to be caucasian. Again, at the end there is an indication that Verbal used Redfoot to avoid giving Kujan a real name. Strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly. Kaiser Soze is said to be Turkish, possibly with a German father. These mixed-up character portraits add a layer of complexity to the plot, but one must always consider the source, Verbal Kint, and his motives. The dynamic between Kujan and Verbal itself is pure entertainment. A kind of cat-and-mouse game, nuances are thrown into the proceedings that make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. Even the way the interrogation is filmed is unique. Verbal didn't achieve his nickname for no reason. He knows how to run his mouth and Kujan has a difficult challenge in corralling him. Underlying the interrogation is Kujan's suspicion of Keaton and his belief that Keaton manipulated Verbal. But Verbal is hard to pin down and Kujan occasionally resorts to bully tactics. But who is Kaiser Soze? Did he orchestrate the police lineup in New York, and pull all the strings ever since? Is the cargo of the ship drugs or only human cargo? Why did Verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not? Did Keaton really die, as Verbal insists, or did he slip away, as Kujan believes? Is Verbal telling the truth? Much is revealed in the final moments of the film, which wash over the viewer like an enormous wave of recognition. Snippets of dialogue from earlier in the film are montaged over the complex score, providing spine-tingling clues about exactly what part of Verbal's yarn was fact and what was fiction. The final snippet of dialogue, followed by a fortissimo string finale is especially powerful: \"and like that...he was gone.\"\n",

It does hinge on something that actually is able to bring the whole house down. Considering what the aim was or one of the target in the movie, certain things seem to make not much sense.But suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride (and keep guessing where it's going) the first time around. After that you can watch it again (and again?) to see the clues and disect the movie in your head. Try to connect the dots and maybe understand what really went down .. then again, considering the premise and the twist, are we actually able to tell? You'll understand once you've seen it ... because it does leave a lot in the open. It does however also have lots of clash between characters and the spite they have for each other ...

            "Review 1: \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" is the story of a musician whose passion in life is to compose great music. But in order to provide for his wife and son, Glenn Holland must take a post as a high school music teacher, which is seemingly the last thing he ever wanted to do. In the thirty-year period of which this story takes place (mid-1960s to mid-1990s), Mr. Holland discovers through his struggles, little by little, student by student, that he indeed has what it takes to become a great teacher and mentor. He applies the entire history of music (\"from Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock-and-roll,\" as he expresses it) in order to help his students learn to appreciate what music is and what it has to offer to the world. Of course, Mr. Holland faces some hard challenges along the way, namely the fact that his numerous teaching responsibilities take him away from giving his son, who has a ninety-percent hearing loss, the attention he desires. In the end, when all of the arts programs get dropped from the school curricula, Mr. Holland believes that all of his teaching efforts have been for nothing. It is then, and only then, that he realizes how much of an impact he has actually made on the entire community.The casting of \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" is terrific. Richard Dreyfuss was THE actor for the leading role of struggling music teacher Glenn Holland, who experiences life with all of its joys and sorrows through music. Glenne Headly is wonderful as Mr. Holland's loving, reasoning, understanding wife Iris. I highly admire Jay Thomas as phys ed teacher Bill Meister, who strikes up a lifetime friendship with Glenn right at the start of Glenn's teaching career. Not to mention Olympia Dukakis in her top-notch portrayal of principal Helen Jacobs, William H. Macy as vice principal Gene Wolters, Alicia Witt as struggling clarinet student Gertrude Lang, Jean Louisa Kelly as the lovely soprano Rowena Morgan, and Terrence Howard as athletic star/drumming novice Louis Russ.Here are my personal favorite scenes from this heartwarming film. Mr. Holland shows his first signs of success when he convinces the self-conscious Gertrude Lang that playing music is meant to be enjoyable and is \"not about notes on a page\"; with this in mind, Gertrude shuns her music stand, closes her eyes, and \"plays the sunset\" on her clarinet. Until Rowena Morgan makes her first appearance, the various singers who audition for the upcoming Gershwin revue prove themselves amusing in their interpretations of \"I Got Rhythm\". A tense moment in the Hollands' household occurs when their little boy Cole, deaf and with virtually no communication skills, has difficulty showing his mother what he wants from the cupboard. Rowena sings a beautiful version of \"Someone to Watch over Me\", with the orchestra conducted by Mr. Holland, on the last night of the Gershwin revue. Shortly after learning that his son is deaf, Mr. Holland is almost in tears as he describes to his music appreciation class the agony of Beethoven's deafness. Following the assassination of musician John Lennon, Mr. Holland sings a nicely orchestrated version of Lennon's \"Beautiful Boy\" and dedicates it to his own son Cole, now a teenager (Joseph Anderson); from then on, Glenn shares a much greater rapport with the forgiving Cole. And finally, Mr. Holland cannot fight back the tears at his high school's surprise celebration of his thirty years as the music teacher; his former student Gertrude Lang, now a governor (Joanna Gleason), makes him aware of all the lives he has touched: \"We are your symphony, Mr. Holland. We are the melodies and the notes of your opus, and we are the music of your life.\" \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" is a film that I believe offers hope to the many people in this world who are forced to take day jobs for which they have no high regard. As this movie progresses, we come to understand how fortunate Glenn Holland's students are to have him for their music teacher.\n",

            "Review 2: Glenn Holland is a young composer.  In the fifties he stops touring with his band to teach music in a school which he hopes will free him from touring to allow him to work on his main love of composing his own music.  Despite initially hating his job, Holland soon learns to enjoy it and how best to communicate the love of music to his pupils.  We trace his life over 30-40years as he has a son with his wife and goes through great emotional times while putting his personal dreams to one side.Although this had `sentimental life lesson film' written all over it, I still wanted to give it a go and strangely still enjoyed it.  The film is very much a bit of praise for all those who are unsung heroes in there lives and it had the potential to be really sickly sentimental.  Happily a good script manages to avoid this for the majority of the time.The weakness of the film is the fact it that it does try to cover a lifetime and occasionally there isn't enough plot to do that well.  I know it would have been difficult but I do feel that the film could have been either a little tighter or filled to overflowing with plot to make it feel shorter. As it is it is still enjoyable but it does feel a little wandering at times  but I guess that's like life in a way.  When the climax comes though it is hard not to be a little moved by the lesson that the film is teaching us.However, the reason for the success of the film is also the reason for it's Oscar nomination  Richard Dreyfuss on good form.  He kept me watching even when the material was stretched.  He is totally believable in the role  for a microcosm of his performance watch his face when the announcement is made about the surprise they have prepared for him  his emotion got me right away!  He deserved his nomination for this as he is captivating over the whole film.  He even ages very convincingly and make up should be congratulated.  However while makeup were concentrating on Dreyfuss they totally forgot about Headly who doesn't age a bit until the final time period (apart from looking a bit tired).  She is badly miscast and she doesn't fit the role at all.  Thomas, Macy, Dukakis and Anderson (as the teenage Cole) all do well in support  but this is Dreyfuss' movie.Overall I enjoyed this.  I usually struggle with things like this because they pile the sentiment on thick like a daytime TVM.  Happily this script avoids that are the majority of the flaws are compensated for by a strong performance from Dreyfuss.\n",

            "Review 3: Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding (as is the whole cast) in this thoroughly enjoyable film.  I really liked it the first time, but with repeated viewings, I'd say that this film got even better.  It's a little predictable, but so what?  For me, it was impossible not to care about these characters, and the ending was the perfect heartwarming note to go out on. It was rather funny as well, but my favourite thing about this movie was the music.  It seems only fitting, considering the importance of music to this film, that it would have a great number of songs, but I was astonished by how much I LOVED the music in this movie.  All-in-all, this was a completely satisfying film, and I would call it a must-see.\n",

            "Review 4: So many people have complained about the Gertrude Lang character (Alicia Witt), Holland's interaction with her, and the purpose of the character, and I am simply amazed at the hostility.1) \"Playing the sunset\" was Holland's way of getting Gertrude to relax so she could play the notes fluidly. They both knew that she didn't sound professional, and wasn't going to. The idea was to get her just above the level of making a fool of herself as she did the first time he called on her in class. Then she could, and did, perform in the band without dragging down the whole ensemble.2) Her goal was not to be a professional musician. Did no one else hear her speech about \"I just wanted to be good at *something*\"? She listed all the fabulous achievements of her parents and siblings, and concluded, \"I'm the only one who's...\" The missing word would have been \"useless\" or \"worthless\". Or \"a failure\". Thirty years later she's the governor (not the mayor!), because in 1966, Holland helped her gain confidence for the first time.3) She wasn't \"wasting\" Holland's efforts by going into politics. Art, music and theater education don't exist solely to create professional artists, musicians and actors. They also exist to give young people an opportunity for change and growth, even if they never use a paintbrush again.I liked that plot twist. Almost every high school has an alumnus who has achieved something in art or entertainment, but a lot of people sell one painting or appear in one film and become a hero to their home town. But there are only fifty states, and it takes an extraordinary amount of drive to become governor of one of them. It's unlikely that she would have taken that first step towards empowerment without Holland.\n",

            "Review 5: The writing of this movie by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Nick of Time), nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe Awards, is one of the best stories that Hollywood ever put on the screen. The sensitivity and perception of the Director Stephen Herek (101 Dalmatians) adds a special touch to the story.Richard Dreyfuss (The Goodbye Girl, The Competition, The American President) was  nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for this role, which is my view one of his best performances. He is good in all stages of the different seasons of the life of Mr. Holland.  I seldom cry while watching a movie,  but when Mr. Holland enters the school auditorium with grey hair and the entire school is applauding when he retires, it makes me cry. I cry every time I watch it,  and I can also cry every time I bring it to mind. If I ever get a part where I have to cry all I have to do is to bring back that memory back!  That moment is a combination of my mother a music teacher and my dad aging. There is no greater love than to lay your life for another... When I graduated from college I wrote a letter thanking my parents for the rainy days they had to go to work,  and for all the sacrifices they made for me and left it on top of the dining room table so they could find when I was not around.  Needless to say that the entire family cried. That is what that scene means to me. I do not see Mr. Holland as a frustrated composer, he was just frustrated because he had other commitments that did not give him the time to compose. Glenne Headly did a great job playing Iris Holland. She has appeared in ER recently. Olympia Dukakis (Steel Magnolias) plays  Principal Jacobs. It is beautiful when close to her retirement she gives Mr. Holland a gift.  Jean Louisa Kell (The Day Lincoln Was Shot) is Rowena Morgan who steals the show because she sings beautifully. William H. Macy, (Fargo) plays Vice Principal Wolters who goes insane when he listens popular music coming from Mr. Holland's classroom. Poor Gertrude Lang,  Alicia Witt (\"Cybill\") is trying so hard to get the technique that she forgets about her feelings. I love when she finally gets to feel the piece and lets herself go.Then when she comes back as grown up is very touching. A music teacher having a deaf child is ironic. Mr. Holland  teaching the kids about Beethoven is marvelous!  I love when Cole (Anthony Natale (II)), comes back as an adult and participates in the celebration of his dad's retirement, and also because he himself is going to teach at the school for the deaf in Washington DC. This movie struck a cord with me because of the music and because of all the elements that were brought into movie and story. I would give it a10 + if I could. It is one of my favorite dramas! I am not much of a drama person, I prefer comedy, but this is a very special drama.\n",

            "Review 6: I love this movie because I had a fantastic, inspirational teacher in high school that all the students admired and looked up to. Even though I was in high school when this movie came out, I still carry the memories. Nicolas Cage deserved to win his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, but I still would have loved to see Richard Dreyfuss win. The whole cast was wonderful, and you actually felt like you were in the 60s and 70s, unlike other films set in that time period. How often does a film come out that generations relate to; and a film so touching about a teacher who cares about his students, and vice versa? Will always be one of my favorite films.\n",

            "Review 7: This is a line of the Beatles' song that Mr. Holland sings to his son, Cole, at a concert. I've seen this movie plenty of times, but for the first time, I noticed just how well this line resonates in this movie. In fact, this line is the basis for the movie, and could stand in for the whole movie in a pinch- except that we would be missing out on one of the most moving and inspirational films to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a man who loves music, who practically lives and breathes music. We see at the beginning of the film, and throughout the rest of it, a man who is most passionate when he is within music. When his wife informs him that she is pregnant, he likens the feeling to falling in love with John Coltrane's music. When a student complains to him that he knows everything there is to know about music, Mr. Holland responds by reminding him that the name of his class is Music Appreciation and explaining forcefully that it doesn't matter how much you know about music if you don't appreciate it.The movie takes Mr. Holland through three decades- from the '60s to the mid-'90s. In the spirit of nostalgia films like Forrest Gump, we are guided through the decades by vignettes of archive footage depicting scenes such as Nixon announcing his resignation, Gerald Ford tripping down the stairs, and even good old Frankenfurter representing the sexual revolution. As a piece of nostalgia for those times and the days of high school, Mr. Holland's Opus works great. As a chronicle of a man's life and the impact he has on others, it works even better.This film could have turned into cheap schmaltz, but through its cast and a story that reaches wonderful poignancy and honesty at times, it manages to represent something so much more than that. Richard Dreyfuss, always a natural actor, is perfectly real and moving as Glenn Holland. I can't describe his performance in words, simply because it deserves to be seen more than just written about. And even though this is basically Dreyfuss's movie, the supporting cast makes an impression as well. Glenne Headly, as Mr. Holland's wife, shows tremendous resilience and emotion as the mother of a disabled child. When she explodes at her husband because of his lack of understanding, you explode with her, because we believe every word she is saying.I don't know if movies can change lives. I think some have the potential to. I know there are movies that can inspire their audiences to be better people- It's a Wonderful Life is one; Casablanca is another. While Mr. Holland's Opus does not reach the quality that those two do (and who can blame it?), it has a similar and near equal impact, and that is definitely a compliment. And how perfect- a movie about a man who changes lives that can also change lives.\n",

            "Review 8: Richard Dreyfus should've won the Oscar nomination, he did a riveting job! The storytelling with everything is so good between the teaching and family. Stephen Herek directed such a charming musical delight that I should've seen sooner. Mr. Holland's Opus was much more than I expected, should've had at least 5 nominations instead of one! The sound is magical throughout, pleasant surprise of entertainment that I'd recommend to anyone.\n",

            "Review 9: I remember seeing \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" for the first time in high school. I liked it then, and still do. Films about teaching often involve tough kids and less than ideal teachers, among other things.  I have to say this film is an exception. Mr. Holland is an inspiration in so many ways that he does not realize or even want to acknowledge. It is also a story that could have taken place and that some people can relate to.  This is why I enjoyed it so much.Mr. Holland has a dream of composing a very memorable and moving symphony, and to ultimately be \"rich and famous.\" But working odd jobs in pursuit of his dream doesn't appeal to him. Reluctantly, he takes a day job as a high school music teacher to support the family and at first hates it. His students are not motivated to learn through readings and tests, and do not respond well to the music of Bach. When he finds they love rock and roll, he integrates this into the curriculum, much of the disapproval of the administration, who believe \"rock and roll by its very nature leads to a breakdown in discipline.\" He teaches and mentors many students over the years, from a clarinet student who doubts her talent and feels inferior to her musically talented family, to a wrestler who becomes a drummer, and a talented singer with her eye on him who wants to go to Broadway despite any barriers. Whether or not he knows it, Mr. Holland inspires them to do something worthwhile.Despite his love and talent for teaching, Mr. Holland cannot develop this same level of rapport and love with his wife Iris and son Cole, who is deaf. His desire for Cole to appreciate music is outweighed by Cole's inability to hear and his father's reluctance to help him. Cole learns sign language from his teachers and mother predominantly. Mr. Holland appears to be the kind of person who detests imperfection of any kind, and this strains his familial relationships. Gradually, though, he learns to accept and deal with these challenges, and becomes more loving and appreciative. I recommend \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" for musicians, singers, music teachers, and really everyone. Enjoy the show!\n",

            "Review 10: It's a MOVIE!  I'm reading comments so vastly polarized to one extreme or another so as not to be believed.Okay, I am a musician.  I've been one on a professional level for over ten years, both as a writer and performer.  And I LOVED this movie (apologies to all those pretentious 'serious' musicians out there).  I enjoyed my theatrical viewing and I have watched my DVD several times.Is MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS musically accurate?  No, of course not, no more so than STAR TREK paying attention to factual science and the laws of physics. But for the most part, nobody other than most of us ego-driven, high horse bound musician types will ever know it.Designed to have a broad appeal outside the aforementioned musically inclined crowd?  Yes, but then so is nearly every movie to come out of Hollywood.  It has to be palatable to a certain degree, and I believe that the much maligned \"Play the sunset\" scene is far more entertaining than having Mr. Holland give us lengthy exposition on the proper articulation and technique that goes into playing a given instrument.And if I hear one more poster scream about Mr. Holland's 'opus' only being ten minutes long (the \"It took him a lifetime to write THIS?\" mantra) I think I'll scream.  Did it ever occur to anybody that what we heard was only a small part of a much larger work?  Most classical and semi-classical pieces occur in (get ready) MOVEMENTS!  It's entirely possible that we only heard the prologue to a much larger piece.  Think outside the box, people.As for the quality of the piece itself, I found it to be acceptable, if not the most dynamic piece of work I've ever heard.  But seeing as how we had been hearing snippets of this piece THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I can't say that I was so overwhelmingly let down as some of our more 'educated and refined' musician types that have posted here.Sure, there were some flaws.  Ms. Headly is not the greatest actress in the world, and beside Dreyfuss she's downright embarrassing.  William Macy's character is so cliched that it warrants no further discussion.  The whole subplot with Rowena and her romantic interest in Mr. Holland ran about ten minutes too long.  And the ending bit where the arts funding gets cut seemed a little too political.But overall, a great film, surely one of Dreyfuss' best, and one of my favorite films.I'm a musician.  And I liked it.  So sue me....\n",

            "Review 11: The first time I saw this film was in the movie theater with one of my best friends--both of us musicians. By the time we left, both of us were bawling our eyes out. This film is very touching and well done. Granted, there are accuracy errors (every film has those) and I've noticed several complaints about the music in the final scene (why are people so nitpicky?). I had a band director much like Mr. Holland when I was in middle school, a man who struggled at first as a teacher but soon became a beloved and inspiring director. Every time I watch this film I think of that man, and how he changed my life for the better. It's a movie I can truly relate to.Okay, enough reminiscing. :P If you want a film that will tug your heartstrings, this is it. Rating 9 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 12: Glenn Holland, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a musician and composer who joins the teaching department at the JFK High School. He initially takes the job in order to earn some quick cash, his aim being to eventually take some time off and write his \"magnum opus\" (a piece of transcendent orchestral music which he hopes will \"change the world\" and \"touch people\"), but what started off as a part time job soon becomes a longterm career, as Glenn battles both students and school staff, constantly fighting to get others to realise the importance and beauty of music (and by extension, art).Eventually Glenn's students become receptive to his message, Glenn using a variety of \"innovative\" and \"out of the box\" teaching methods to win them over. The film highlights the erosion of creativity within schools, the power of art, the way these institutions degrade the mind, how school syllabuses are subject to budget cuts and outside job demands, but mostly it says that no life spent in a worthy pursuit is wasted.Glenn Holland may not have been able to write the \"magnum opus\" he dreamt of, but he did something equally important. He touched the lives of thousands of students, inspiring and influencing them in countless ways. Glenn's life was a symphony, Glenn's existence a piece of music, and that, the film says, is worth celebrating.In other words, the film is pure cheese. But if you look past all the sentimentality, the heavy-handed tear jerking, the film has a worthwhile message. It says that teaching art is one thing, but living like an artist and inspiring others to do so is an entirely different thing altogether. It's a love letter to beauty and creativity.Beyond this you have a nice performance by Richard Dreyfuss in the lead and, ironically, some terrible music throughout. Why do films about music (think \"The Pianist\") often feature bad music? 7.9/10 – The \"teacher genre\" is filled with films like this. \"Dead Poet's Society, \"Coach Carter\", \"Dangerous Minds\", \"Good Will Hunting\", \"Stand and Deliver\", \"Mona Lisa Smile\", \"The Substitute\", \"Freedom Writers\", \"School of Rock\" etc, all follow a similar plot.Interestingly, whilst most films that seek to show changes to a character over a significant span of time use a relatively young actor and then add makeup to make him look older, \"Mr Holland's Opus\" does the opposite, choosing a performer whose actual age closely matches the final age of the main character, then using makeup to rejuvenate him for the film's early sequences. Surprisingly, the result works better than the usual approach.\n",

            "Review 13: What a wonderful movie. I just watched it and am in awe of Richard Dreyfuss' amazing acting. Only being 15 but an avid music lover myself, I sat there wishing I had a teacher like Mr. Holland that inspired me like so many of the students in the movie, that made learning fun by connecting with the students, by doing everything Mr. Holland did. The stories of the students were real and believable. I connected with the girl that played the clarinet, Gertrude Lang, because sometimes I even feel that I'm never good at anything.Every person of every age can appreciate and love this movie. At the end, when Mr. Holland's goodbye party was discovered in the gym and he took the stage, I was crying.What a wonderful movie. History-wise, music-wise, and story-wise.\n",

            "Review 14: In September, 1994, my mom and I were in the checkout line in Powell's Bookstore in Portland, Oregon. There was a very short man in front of us. When we got up to the cashier, she identified the man as none other than Richard Dreyfuss. We turned around and sure enough, it was he. Needless to say, we wondered what he was doing in Portland.A little over a year later, we found out what he was doing when \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" got released. We thought that it was one of the best movies that year. We all really liked that it portrayed how sad he got when John Lennon got assassinated. A very good movie.About a year later, Richard Dreyfuss appeared at Grant High School again. He made a speech encouraging people to vote in the upcoming election.All in all, a great movie. I recommend it to everyone. Also starring Glenne Headly, Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy. Strange that Stephen Herek also directed movies such as \"Critters\".\n",

            "Review 15: I'm sure I've said it in one or more of my other reviews, but I don't think I could ever be a teacher. I just don't have the patience for it, and I have to admire someone like Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) who can put aside those feelings of frustration when it seems like he's not connecting with his students, or when they're just not that interested in what he's teaching. The story actually starts out that way, and I could identify with Holland the first time he erupts in class, only with me, it would probably be for the entire semester. So I acknowledge that deficiency on my part, and give teachers all the credit in the world they deserve. The interesting thing is how Mr. Holland found himself stuck as a teacher much the same way young student Gertrude Lang remained stuck as an ineffective musician. Holland needed to reach into his inner reservoir of humanity to strike just the right chord in order for Gertrude to overcome the obstacle that hindered her ability. Once that hurdle was cleared, she was able to participate in the band successfully, even if it was not her career ambition. I liked the way that scenario played out. I think we probably all have had teachers in our past that struck just that right chord to make classroom participation enjoyable and steer us in the right direction. It wasn't until Holland introduced his class to the connection between Bach and rock n' roll that he really hit his stride. Making subjects fun is an admirable skill that a lot of teachers just don't get. It's unfortunate however that Holland couldn't translate some of that teaching ability to his home life and relationship with his own son. But that in time did also improve, a case of Holland learning how to be a talented human being as well as a talented teacher. So all in all, \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" is an inspiring story, showing how a single individual can affect the lives of so many in ways that are both visible and invisible. Every school deserves to have at least one teacher on board like Mr. Holland, inspiring students and faculty alike.\n",

            "Review 16: Although this is not entirely Richard Dreyfuss's film, surrounded as he is by an excellent cast, he holds the film entirely on his shoulders. He has made many films over the years and has hit some memorable home runs. Think of Close Encounters, Jaws and you've got between the two films some very big hits which delivered terrific entertainment fun. I've enjoyed his work over the years and even his lesser known works such as \"Tin Men\" are quite enjoyable and have worn well over the years.In \"Mr. Holland's Opus\", Dreyfuss is given lots of depth to his character and he wasted no time filling in the form. The subject and script must have excited him because his performance is strong, centered, not overblown or over sentimentalized, touching, emotional when necessary and reserved when called for. There is an especially magical moment when he is in a close up with the student who excelled at singing (can't recall her name). They have an obvious sexual undercurrent going and we are led to believe, breath by breath that they will embrace and yet Dreyfuss takes his body language just to the furthest edge and then holds. The tension collapses when someone walks in the room and we are amazed that they did not kiss. It's a really great scene that aspiring actors should study; here is a pro who shows how to act with finesse.The story is terrific and the plot carefully includes many characters and although some verge on stereotypes, they all appear quite believable and human and much of this has to do with the quality of the actors and the lines they emote. There is a strong impulse to drive this film into a 'heart on your sleeves' climax and it does stray briefly into this mode. However, by the time the film is over the build up of love for this man is so immense and overpowering that the surprise he gets at the very end just makes us all weep with joy.I especially enjoyed how his character finally learned about his own failures as a father and rather than sink into depression and recrimination, he rose to that challenge in the same insightful way his entire teaching career was handled.The film is a complete joy from beginning to end; the cast as I say was superb. Given a terrific story and sensitive direction from Stephen Herek, this is as good as film entertainment ever gets. Keep the tissue box close at hand; it's a tearful joy and not easily forgotten.\n",

            "Review 17: A composer (Richard Dreyfuss) puts his lofty ambitions on hold to become a high school music teacher in Portland, Oregon, from 1965-1995. Glenne Headly plays his wife, Jay Thomas the coach, Olympia Dukakis the principal and William H. Macy the irritating vice principal.\"Mr. Holland's Opus\" (1995) is a good school-oriented drama that's episodic in nature since it spans 30 years. The first 40 minutes were decent, but I was wondering if the film would be able to absorb me into its story, especially considering its considerable length. It did, particularly the episodes concerning Terrence Howard (playing Louis Russ) and angelic Jean Louisa Kelly (Rowena).The movie's kind of a meshing of \"Dead Poets Society\" (1989) crossed with \"Forrest Gump\" (1994), although not great like either of those flicks. But it's a solid drama. A 19 year-old Alicia Witt is on hand as one of the students in the first act.The film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes and was shot in Portland, Oregon, and nearby Marylhurst.GRADE: B\n",

            "Review 18: Opus literally means \"work\" in Latin. And this affecting tale of a man's life work is one of the best made in recent years.The movie starts in the fall of 1965 when Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) starts teaching at John F. Kennedy High School (which is in the process of being renamed as he arrives). Mr. Holland was playing keyboards with a band, but has tired of touring and wants time to settle down and write his own music. He finds teaching to not be much to his liking at first. The kids aren't interested, and he doesn't know how to get through to them. In addition, his principal, Mrs. Jacobs (Olympia Dukakis), is always on his back, as is the Vice Principal, Mr. Wolters (William H. Macy). His only friend on the faculty turns out to be the football coach, Bill Meister (Jay Thomas). His complaints to his wife, Iris (Glenne Headley), are met with sympathy at first, but when he learns she is pregnant, he realizes that he needs this job to support his soon to be larger family. At that point, he commits and becomes an excellent teacher, learning how to connect to the kinds of music the kids like and relate it back to the classics he is required to teach. Along the way, he reaches several students: a young clarinet player (Alicia Witt), a football player (Terrence Howard) who learns to play the drums in order to keep his GPA high enough to continue to play - an undertaking done at the request of Meister, a gifted young singer (Jean Louisa Kelly) who longs to make music rather than work in her parents business and who develops a bit of a crush on Mr. Holland. His personal life fares a little less well. His only son, Cole (Nicholas John Renner, Joseph Anderson, or Anthony Natale depending on the age) is born deaf, and he can't share his father's love of music. Or so Mr. Holland thinks, until he realizes his frustration has shut his son out of his life. Once again, he rises to the challenge. However, it is only when the music program is cut from the curriculum, and Mr. Holland is forced to retire that he realizes what his true life's work has been.It's a brilliant script. Mr. Holland's passion for life - music, his work, his family - is wonderfully depicted, and contrasted against his own limitations in being able to achieve his goals. When faced with his shortcomings, he does something about them, and in the end triumphs because of it. And having his former students come back and show him how he has influenced their lives is an especially nice touch.The acting is excellent. Dreyfuss is a skilled actor, and he brings a warmth to the part that contrasts nicely with Mr. Holland's less appealing characteristics. Headley gives a sweet performance as a woman who loves her family and stands by them no matter what. The scene where she expresses her frustration at not being able to communicate with her son is especially well done. Thomas puts in a nice turn as the football coach. I'm not a big fan of Macy, but he does pretty well as the vice principal. Dukakis is nothing short of fabulous as the principal who decides to mentor Mr. Holland whether he wants her to or not.Yes, it's a tear jerker of a movie, especially the ending. But it's well worth the sacrifice of Kleenex, whether it's the first time or the hundred and first. This is a movie that says yes, anyone can make a difference in ways they never dreamed of.\n",

            "Review 19: Finally, a realistic picture about teaching.Richard Dreyfuss is memorable as a new teacher in Mr. Holland's Opus.He begins a 30 year career as a music teacher in a large high school. He comes across his principal, Mrs. Jacobs, who demands a month of lesson plans in advance on her desk in the morning. Any teacher can understand what that is. Then, there is an assistant principal, devilishly played by, William H. Macy, who takes an instant dislike to Mr. Holland. He can't wait to\"rat\" him out to Mrs. Jacobs.Seeing that traditional teaching methods are not working, Holland tries unorthodox ways which of course riles Macy.The irony that a music teacher would have a child who is deaf. Beethoven could best understand that frustration.When Mrs. Jacobs informs Holland of her retirement, she says something to him that all teachers would love to hear: \"You were my favorite teacher.\" Of course, Macy becomes the principal and as the years pass,the two still have a contentious relationship, as their hair turns gray.Holland works on that forever opus and is almost ready to give everything up and run away with a student until common sense prevails.After 30 years, there are budget cuts and the Music Department will be eliminated. Sounds familiar in today's climate?Mr. Holland will be forced into retirement but not before a rousing tribute by his present and former pupils. One very special student appears and it's a delight to see how far she has come.Richard Dreyfuss, in a memorable Oscar nominated performance, is magnificent. He conveys the ideals of a teacher and what we have to go through. This is truly a welcomed film for its reality and emotions shown.\n",

            "Review 20: A masterful tribute to music teachers. My own son, now a college freshman, played in the school band for seven years (through both middle and high school), so our household had first hand experience with a dedicated music teacher and could relate well to Mr. Holland's contribution. Richard Dreyfuss is brilliant as the would be composer, Mr. Holland, who must reluctantly resort to teaching in order to support himself and his pregnant wife. As the film chronicles for close to three decades, we witness Mr. Holland's aging (effectively done), the changing styles, fads, and current issues of high school students, the growing up of his deaf son, and most of all, the emergence and development of Mr. Holland's teaching skills and the impact they have on the lives of his students, both musically and personally.Mr. Holland has a tremendous effect on his students, to name a few...a timid clarinet player with low self esteem who eventually becomes state governor, a wrestler transformed (after much effort) into a drummer who is later killed in Vietnam, and a talented singer who ends up heading for Broadway. These instances may remind many viewers of that 'special teacher' in their own lives, whatever the subject. I agree with another reviewer that even for those such as the clarinet playing governor, who don't pursue music as a career, having musical training during childhood & adolescence makes for a lifelong enriching experience. People are not one dimensional, with their job the only significant factor in their lives. The afore mentioned singer, Rowena, who has a serious crush on her teacher & mentor, brings one of the more interesting sub-plot lines to the story as Mr. Holland (experiencing some marital difficulties and despairing the lack of composition success he's dreamed of) is tempted to join her when she departs for the Big Apple. I thought the scene extremely moving when his wife discovers from the musical program that this lovely, talented young student is the mysterious 'Rowena' of her husband's composition and suspects (fears) a romantic interest. Also, Mr. Holland's viewing of his family's photo album is dramatic under these circumstances of temptation. How refreshing (for once, in Hollywood) that our hero 'does the right thing'. I admit to being disappointed that an older Rowena doesn't reappear at the end concert as a famous Broadway star. The two of them could have had an interesting moment there, and I was waiting for it.The depiction of the parents' struggles with Mr. Holland's deaf son, Cole (especially given the father's musical career), is effectively done and gives us all a better appreciation of obstacles faced by those with disabilities and their families.The funding dilemmas for academics, arts, & athletics in the school system are always relevant. Band has recently been cut in my own son's former high school, a tragedy. I wish Mr. Holland's music program could have been re-instated. As one commenter noted, pity his former students couldn't have had a fund-raiser or mass protest to officialdom so that their children would not be denied the musical opportunities they themselves experienced.As for the end concert, it's dramatic beyond words and must have given Mr. Holland the real definition of success. This scene certainly came to mind a couple of years back when I attended a retirement banquet for my own son's middle school music teacher, with entertainment provided by a band consisting of both present and former students. There are many Mr. Hollands out there in the school system today, and they especially must be gratified by this recognition of their generally unheralded efforts.\n",

            "Review 21: With all of the trashy, throw-away, so-called \"stars\" out there, a small handful of folks have always stood out on the basis of sheer acting talent. Richard Dreyfus is among them.I first got turned on to him with THE GOODBYE GIRL, and something just clicked. THIS was the Real Thing! After JAWS, I started looking for more... and promptly found a quirky, offbeat offering, THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ.Three wildly different roles... and all handled to perfection. THIS MAN IS AN ACTOR! After a succession of other roles, Dreyfus hit THE role, the one he can always be proud of... playing Glen Holland, the reluctant music teacher who came to love the profession that life and circumstances had forced him into.The greatest gift MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS gave to me was an appreciation for a person in my own life... for the first time in several decades, I thought of my personal Mr. Holland, band director Herbert Rifkind of Chicago Vocational High School. Mr. Holland and Herb Rifkind couldn't have been more different people; Herb had been part of the Marine Corps Band in Washington, and tho he'd moderated the military approach to one more suitable for dealing with high school kids, his band was a tight and precise machine, carefully trained with patience and love.Holland's \"marching buddy\" practice, and the sound of the drummer's Street Beat winding up at the start of the parade instantly took me back across decades... during halftime in a football game in Soldier Field in Chicago, steering 40 pounds of reluctant brass Sousaphone through a high wind while maintaining precise marching interval and cadence in the ankle deep mud, all the while struggling for perfection on the bass obbligato of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\"...We didn't do it for glory, or even for ourselves... tho we'd have never admitted it back then, the band did it right to keep from letting Mr. Rifkind down. Holland and Rifkind were alike in that way; he was our best friend on the faculty, and the one that we now remember with a special fondness.The Rifkinds and Hollands of this world probably have the most profound effect on their students of any high school faculty member; they give their kids something of VALUE that lasts a lifetime; an appreciation for music, and the self discipline that's needed to master a musical instrument or navigate life.Holland and Rifkind are very special people... simple men, doing a job that they love, but a job that affects every student they ever encounter for a lifetime. It was time that somebody made a movie about these unsung heros.Dreyfus did it RIGHT.\n",

As an English teacher, I too aspire to break out the best novel to pull me out of my world. Teaching is hard and rewarding. It's not easy. Don't let anybody fool you otherwise. Richard Dreyfuss' performance as Glenn Holland is not only memorable but unforgettable one of his best roles. Glenne Headly is terrific as his wife. He has a fantastic supporting cast like Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt, and others to support the film. The film is kind of a downer about a man who has spent thirty years of his life as a teacher in a small town. I was troubled by the fact that he and his wife stopped having children after Cole was born. I thought the deafness was to create friction between the musical father and his deaf son. Still, it's a good film. You'll cry a little.\n",

            "Review 23: The make-up department does a splendid job in ageing Richard Dreyfuss in Stepehen Herek's film about an aspiring composer turned music teacher who finds his vocation over thirty years. It's a good performance from Dreyfuss as well, and the movie also benefits from a reliably creepy turn from William Macy as Dreyfusss' boss. In fact, as a portrait of a life set against a changing political, and musical, landscape, showing how (in the words of a song that features in the plot), \"life is what happens while we're busy making plans\", it reminded me of the epic BBC drama series, 'Our Friends in the North'. But it lacks the deeper engagement of that series with the specifics of the times it portrays, and at times seems a little trite as a result. Dreyfuss was Oscar-nominated for his role and this is definitely the sort of film that gets considered at these awards: earnest, gently liberal, ultimately upbeat and essentially unthreatening. And you can take that as condemnation or commendation, as you will; but I enjoyed it.\n",

            "Review 24: There are plenty of films about the effect of teacher's over the years on their students. The best known is GOODBYE MR. CHIPS with Robert Donat, but there are others (GOOD MORNING, MISS DOVE, for example). The tragic personal life of the teacher as opposed to his or her dedication to the students is the subject of the drama. Yet the formula works when does well, and MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS was an example of such a successful version.Richard Dreyfus is Glenn Holland, who has been hired in 1965 to teach music appreciation at JOHN F. KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL (the principal is Olympia Dukakis, and the vice principal is William H. Macy). Holland's wife (Iris - Glenne Headley) and there child Cole are in a house in the town, and we watch his domestic tragedy - not so much with his wife, but that their son is deaf. Holland concentrates over time on his students, and his constant warfare with the vice principal on matters like rock and roll or the values of music appreciation in learning. Among the students he helps are young athletes trying to accomplish academic achievement, young women trying to break into the field of entertainment or trying to bolster their self-confidence. But he is constantly brought up short by the problems of his relations with his family - especially as his son Cole grows up (Joseph Anderson - age 15 Cole here). Cole is deaf but he is intelligent, and he blows up when Glenn fails to realize that Cole is intelligent about music - a subject he thinks Cole can never share with him.The running thread through all this is that Glenn began the teaching gig as a money maker while he creates his musical masterpiece - a symphony. But both the home life and the school work take up all his time. Yet, as the film ends he realizes that he did leave an imprint on his students, and he did prove a warm and loving husband and father despite real strains due to Cole's condition. The film ends with a proper validation of his full success.Dreyfus was wonderful as Glenn (ably supported by Headley, Macy, Dukakis, and Jay Thomas as his friend the sports coach), and got nominated for a second Best Actor Oscar. While he did not win, his career rejuvenated. And he would eventually try (with Thomas) to do a television show in the next decade that dealt with the problems of a teacher in a high school.\n",

            "Review 25: Taking a position as a high school music teacher in order to pay the bills, an aspiring composer finds the job unexpectedly challenging but also unexpectedly rewarding in this Oscar nominated drama starring Richard Dreyfuss. The film gets off to a solid start with Dreyfuss discovering his every preconception of teaching challenged; there is no \"free time\", \"high school is not a democracy\" and it is absolutely impossible to leave campus at the same time as his students do. The movie missteps though by not spending more time on this section of his journey; before long, Dreyfuss transforms into an obsessively motivated teacher who has simply come to accept the demands of the job. A deaf son is eventually thrown into the mix to give Dreyfuss a chance to realise how his obsession with his job is negatively impacting on home life, but there is nothing especially novel or exciting about this plot development. A maudlin music score does not help matters either. In fact, were it not for its towering lead performance, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' would be difficult to endure. Fortunately, Dreyfuss is in fine form, credibly ageing over 30 years during the course of the movie. The film also does a good job capturing his reactions to various historical events over the three decades portrayed on screen (his grief over John Lennon's death is highly memorable). Whether this alone is enough to render the film worth viewing may vary per viewer. Clocking in at nearly two and half hours long, the film is not an easy, breezy watch, but fans of its lead actor might well find it worthwhile.\n",

            "Review 1: Broken Arrow (1996) is one of my favorite John Woo best US action films alongside Hard Target which is my first John Woo favorite film, Broken Arrow is my third personal favorite John Woo action film that I love to death! Hard Target was his first American movie, this is his second American movie, which I think is incredible classic action thriller from the 90's I have ever saw. It is going to be 20. years since this movie come out and i still love it today more than any other movie.I love John Travolta in this movie which I think he did one of his best acting performances of his life. He acted convincing as the main villain Deakins in this movie. Broken Arrow has a great score, great actors and different style of terrorists, who stole nuclear warheads, but didn't took over some plant or building or plane or train etc.. It is completely different action movie. Christian Slater was awesome as the main hero. I love this movie and it is never too long or boring unlike Face/Off. In my honest opinion the movie to me is compared to Die Hard and it is one of John Woo's best underrated action movies but that is just my opinion. It is a die hard movie in a desert heat much a like as Stallone's Cliffhanger. But with very different story and it is a stand alone movie which I love that. John Woo never liked making sequels so A Better Tomorrow II (1987) was his last sequel he made, so I am glad this movie doesn't have any sequels, remakes or reboot. In my opinion the 80's had a lot of better action movies, but the 90's had a very cool action movies too. I still love Die Hard With A Vengeance to death and still love other action movies that were made in 90's. I love Broken Arrow to death! It is my favorite John Woo movie! This is a great film recently and it is a cool action movie. It's got action, excitement and interesting characters and Legendary music. I love this film. Christian Slater as the Good guy, the Hero was cool and John Travolta was an intriguing character and hilarious, damn what a rush. The action in here is amazing. Fun action, good acting, quick pace, and entertaining. The final sequence on the train has some quality explosions and even has bad guys killed by helicopter blades. The best thing about this movie though is John Travolta who hams it up beautifully; he is having an absolute blast as Vic Deakins, former US Air Force pilot turned terrorist loon. He also has one of the most over the top and awesome bad guy deaths of all time. I have always enjoyed this movie, I never felt bored I love the action sequences on the train when Hale (Christian Slater) uses one of his martial arts to defeat Deakins (John Travolta) was spectacular he deactivate the nuclear device and kills Deakins it was outstanding. Hans Zimmer theme for Deakins ripped off movie Scream 2 for Dewey (David Arquette) theme. Hans Zimmer provides one of his greatest scores to this movie with some nice twanging guitar from Duane Eddie. I love how any time Travolta is on screen he has this hilarious guitar theme tune which is cool, but hilarious funny at the same time. Broken Arrow has Woo's trademark slow motion and double gun-play galore. I believe there is the odd pigeon thrown in for good measure too. Not entirely sure Samantha Mathis was all that great as the female love interest, but it is cool to have a Pump up the Volume reunion (1990). Which I never watched that movie before I am glad they both of the actors (Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis) worked together once more again.Broken Arrow has plenty of flaws but for sheer explosive entertainment you could do a lot worse. I love the movie and could watch it on repeat. The music is also totally epic. This movie get's is a perfect 10 by me. Last Year it was hardly for my supplier of Blu-ray's to get me this movie on Blu-ray I actually have this film in Blu-ray collection this one and Stallone's Cop Land was so hard to find. I have them both on Blu-ray discs.\n",

            "Review 2: Usually I'm the first person to label this sort of movie. Look at it. It's got the usual assortment of cliches and conventions. The John Woo directed action scenes stretch over the top. There's a mentally unstable talkative nemesis, a predictable betrayal and even one of those bombs that graces us with a digital readout. All prerequisites for movies of a certain quality and after saying all that - I'd usually be complaining about now.Yet for one reason I can't. This movie really entertained me. It finds a way to come together in a really enjoyably manner and I'm happy with what I got. I can't bad mouth it. Nothing got in my way of everlasting enjoyment of seeing baddies die, bombs going off and the baritone guitar instrumental. It just all clicks from the get-go.If your reading this you don't need me to recycle the plot summary. It's of a trivial nature. Good action, decent cast and a fun atmosphere go a long way with Travolta ultimately holding it all together. He plays his role to the hilt and delivers some fantastic lines. Him and Slater tango pretty well too. Travolta makes for a great bad guy and good action movies require great bad guys. Chances are anyone else in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review. A guilty pleasure if there ever was one.\n",

            "Review 3: There are so many stupid action movies out there -- mind-numbing, explosion-filled, cartoonish, slow-motion-bodies-falling, gore, ugly guns, special f/x, mismatched heroic couple of mixed sex, wisecracking villain -- and I've SEEN so many that I'm beginning to be able to tell the difference between them.This is one of the better ones. The plot has John Travolta as the smiling treacherous heavy, and Christian Slater as the true-blue captain in the USAF out to spoil Travolta's plot to blow up Denver with a kidnapped nuclear device. There is a cute red head thrown fortuitously together with Slater. She has nice plump lips, big blue eyes, and the tightly tailored slacks of a Park Ranger. Very nice. We watch her from below as she climbs the ladder on the side of a boxcar. There's no reason for her to be IN the movie except to have her climb boxcars, roll down sandy hills, and so on.But then there's no particular reason for ANYTHING to be in the movie. What I mean is that if you found it necessary to leave the room for a minute or two -- a knock on the door, a tug on the trigonal, whatever -- you would find that you hand't missed much when you returned. None of the characters changes in any way. There is no dialogue worth remembering. There are some unusual special effects but if you've missed one example it's okay because another is right around the corner. I particularly enjoy the scene in which the exploding bomb takes out the helicopter.I've sat through this thing three times and I am now convinced it has turned the higher reasoning centers of my brain into tofu. That's why I genuinely like it. I like it for Travolta's toothy reptilian grin, for Slater's imitation of Jack Nicholson, for the ripoffs from \"Indiana Jones,\" for the gorgeous Utah scenery, for the rocketing diesel train, Lake Powell, the redhead climbing the ladder, the fist fights, the bouncing Humvees, the civilian who proudly announces he used to be a lieutenant in the ROTC at Yale, the redhead climbing the ladder, the bodies of people who tumble in slow motion towards the camera as a fireball explodes behind them (three times), the redhead climbing the ladder.I just like it, that's all. Anybody up for some sesame oil?\n",

            "Review 4: In his \"TV Movies and Video Guide,\" Leonard Maltin asks, \"Why was this movie made?\"  The answer is simple:  To entertain the people.  I was certainly entertained by this far-fetched action thriller, due in no small part to John Woo's imaginative direction of the action sequences.  John Travolta overdoes the psycho routine, hamming it up when some restraint would have made for a more believable performance, but his considerable charm sees him through.  Christian Slater, an actor who hasn't impressed me as anything more than a Jack Nicholson wannabe, makes a surprisingly commendable hero. This movie is junk food, of course, but it's very tasty indeed.\n",

His goal is to sell the weapons back to the United States government by blackmailing them.  Old partner Christian Slater is willing to stop Travolta at all costs with the help of ranger Samantha Mathis.  Howie Long makes an impressive film debut as Travolta's evil henchman.  The screenplay is smart enough to work and the direction is fast and furious.  A film that is about as good as it can be.  4 stars out of 5.\n",

            "Review 7: John Woo's continued attempt to translate his foreign success into Hollywood gold sees him take on bigger stars than Van Damme in Christian Slater and the resurrected star of Travolta.  Slater and Travolta play pilots testing a new bomber, when one of them decides to steal the missiles on board the other must begin a personal fight to stop him.As with Hard Target this is a solid enough action movie but it really could have been made by anyone, Woo's style only really comes through in a few scenes (the birds eye view of the opening boxing match, double handed gun play).  This is a shame because the action scenes only occasionally get better than average.The plot is weak and relies a lot on coincident and luck to keep things moving.  This is quite insulting to an audience because it just shows that the script writers couldn't fix the plot as a workable story and decided to try and get this past.  Travolta overplays the villain well, but perhaps overdoes the ticks and the madness a bit too much to be believable.  Slater clearly wants to be like Keanu was in Speed but doesn't convince as an action hero, Mathis is cute but that doesn't make her performance good - she pretty much a non-entity and doesn't really have much chemistry with Slater.Again a solid action movie that is OK for a Saturday night, but with the stars, the budget and a director of this calibre you can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity.\n",

            "Review 8: Like nearly every other in this genre BROKEN ARROW is dumb with a capital DUM . It suffers from a myriad of plot holes and factual errors that anyone who has surfed the net looking through sites dedicated to the military will be able to spot at once . One early example is when the pilots eject and control have no idea to their fate . It's a well known fact that pilot suits contain a homing beacon so pilots who eject on missions can be instantly traced We as an audience are supposed to forgive this ignorance and this audience member found it very easy to . Yeah it's a Hollywood movie from the 1990s so we're treated to very unlikely plot twists in a movie where the good guy and an innocent woman just doing her job have to stop bad guys so get ready for firefights , explosions and the obligatory scene of a countdown BROKEN ARROW might not be a classic action adventure movie ( It's a little too formuliac ) but it's better than most from the 1990s . Travolta purposely does an impression of Tom Cruise except he's a bad ass and Christian Slater may seem an unlikely action hero but he's far more convincing than Steven Seagal or even Keanu Reeves . John Woo directs in a workman like manner and though it's not his best movie Woo does treat us to some spectacular and grisly deaths\n",

            "Review 9: If you want an action film in which the hero has a personality, and the bad guy has an even better personality, take a look at Broken Arrow.  John Woo's choreographed action is not as dramatic as the Matrix-clone films that are so common today.  He is great at creating interesting relationships between heroes and villains, and this film is a good example.John Travolta is terrific.  Christian Slater breaks typecast by playing a nice, sane soldier doing his duty.  The love interest isn't an idiotic supermodel playing a nuclear scientist or something, but a park ranger, also doing her duty.  She is cute, earthy, and actually believable.If you want a film that will repeat every aspect of every other military adventure film you have ever seen, you will be disappointed.  If dialog bores you, skip this film.  If you like action movies filmed entirely in parking garages and spooky allies, then you will not appreciate the settings in this film in America's majestic West.\n",

            "Review 10: Well. What can I say? This film is rather typical and has the same amount of violence as many other action-thrillers. (But perhaps a little more?) Despite this, it was very enjoyable and in my opinion deserves 6.5 stars-slightly more than it actually got. I never realized that Travolta was such a good \"bad guy\" actor and almost deserved an Oscar! But Christian Slater was just as good as the out and out good guy, along with Terry Carmichael as his side-kick. The ending was short but effective, because of the pleasing lack of sentimentality and sexism. Keep up the good films, because I certainly enjoyed this one.\n",

            "Review 11: After \"Terminator 2\" this is one of the best directed action thrillers I have seen and it finds for ever a place in my best of DVD collection. There are two masters for action movies for me: John Woo and James Cameron. The stunts were great and all very real executed. I mean there doesn't exist any cartoonish scenes as we see today in the cinema at times. John Travolta did perhaps after \"Face Off\" one of the best jobs in his career. If you liked it I highly recommend the other broken arrow film called \"The Sum of All Fears\". \"Broken Arrow\" is incredibly underrated and should be classified as T2. For all action fans a must see, you won´t be disappointed.My wife and I vote 9.5/10.\n",

            "Review 12: My Take: Mindless, balls-to-the-wall action thriller. Grab on to that chair.BROKEN ARROW may be required to take a deep long breath, because when it starts, it's a ripping action-packed joy ride complete with guns, explosions, action heroes, great baddies, helicopters, jeeps, chases and all under the great helm of Hong Kong action god John Woo, here having a filed day with special effects, stunts and style. It may be off on implausibility, but you won't need much to think about once the theater gets dark. And when the theater does get dark, and the film starts, the action just keeps pouring in. Woo delivers style over substance (there's more action here than plot), but what style! This is one of the finest piece of action escapism in years, it's also one of the most stylish ones.John Travolta and Christian Slater star as two military pilots who volunteers to transport two nuclear warheads via Stealth Bomber jet. Turns out, the true reason is Maj. Deakins (Travolta), who is still in a grudge after being passed from promotion for a long time, is out to steal the two bombs and hold the for ransom. When he ejects his partner Capt. Riley Hale (Slater) and crashes the jet in the middle of the desert, Hale is out to stop his old partner from detonating the nuclear bombs if his demands of a large amount of cash is met. Samantha Mathis co-stars as a local sheriff Terry Carmichael who gets caught up in the entire mess, and ends up helping Hale out to stop Deakins from going ballistic (there are very few romantic in-turns between the two, just for the good of it).The film runs at 108 minutes, and Woo doesn't let things up. There's action here and action there. It's wall-to-wall full of action and less plot in comparison. The film's plot resembles that of the previous year's hit SPEED, which may due to the writer being Graham Yost, who also wrote that recent blockbuster hit. But who cares, both films take liberty from the DIE HARD films, and they both turned up well. In the matter of execution, this derivative affair is brought with style and pure wall-to-wall action and thrills. And, under Woo's hands, the action is done with style and freshness.Although with a large amount of violence, Woo is the kind of action who treats them like paint in his canvas. Action fans will be pleased by how who treats the heart-pounding excitement and pure action as his ballet . It's action filmdom as a form of art. Highly recommended!Rating: **** out of 5.\n",

            "Review 13: What a sophomoric action-adventure story this turned out to be, one in which nobody can shoot straight, people aren't killed when they are supposed to be, the heroes get out of impossible situations all the time, etc., etc., all making this a movie with absolutely NO credibility.Tack on a very irritating female heroine who turns from park ranger to Rambo overnight, and it really gets ludicrous.However, there were a few bright moments. There are some great shots of the Grand Canyon and of Utah and the underground nuclear bomb explosion is spectacular with excellent sound. Then again, one can always except spectacular action shots from director John Woo. However, most of Woo's films are also dumb, like this one.John Travolta was fine in a low-key role but the rest of the cast.....forget it. It's too stupid a movie to recommend.\n",

The picture displays suspense, tension, thriller and non-stop action for 108 minutes, adding a surprising ending train duel. Major Vic \"Deak\" Deakins (John Travolta) and Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater) are pilots in the United States Air Force, stationed in the southwest United States. Then terrorists steal nuclear warheads from the U. S. military but don't count on a pilot and park ranger spoiling their plans.

Prepare to Go Ballistic !This high-powered, streamlined film contains nail-biting set pieces action well staged by John Woo with jumps and more leaps while they're shooting. Hong Kong action king Woo once again attempts his hand at the big-budget Hollywood action extravaganza, with mixed and uneven results. There are no rough edges in Woo's second Hollywood outing, working with more money than on his first (Hard Target), a better cast and a script by prestigious Graham Yost (Speed), the director has fashioned a comfortably ludricous entertainment with its ups and downs. You're never bored in a Woo film, he's the kind of stylist who does\n",
            "everything to the max. Mostly what he does is action and this script is tailor-made: a series of superb set-pieces in which a nuclear explosion is far from the climax. Packing triple storyline, whammy of cheesy dialogue, continuity problems, and unpredictabily undercuts, but doesn't obscure, his talent for choreographing mayhem. What follows is a balletic bloodbath typical of the director of¨A bullet in the head¨ and ¨Hard-boiled¨with men flying while leaping through the air, or turning somersaults to avoid bullets. Travolta plays the all-American-boy as creepily charming psychotic to great effect, in similar style to character he played in Face off. Travolta and Slater both get play the villain and hero in this sporadically ridiculous but consistingly thrilling film about two pilots confronting again and again until an overlong and incredible final duel. With two of Hollywood's most flamboyant actors playing each other, the film becomes a kind of elabotate self-parody and quasi-serious examination of the art of film acting. They're excessive maniacal, exaggerated villains, they're the best of the film, too. This is a nice picture with tight , mind-bogging twists and turns , alongside moving musical score by Hans Zimmer composed by an overwhelming synthesizer and colorful cinematography by Peter Levy. Well made high-tech hinkins and with plenty of impressive set pieces along with a flamboyant treatment and gorgeous images. Filmmaker John Woo brings his trademark ballets style to the action with a lot of plot twists. The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Woo , who originally did not want to do his trademark \"Mexican Standoff\" in this film , but John Travolta begged Woo to include the scene having been a great aficionado of Woo's films as Better tomorrow (1988) , The Killer (1989) , Bullet in head (1990) and Hard Boiled (1992). Woo's poetic-kinetic style has evolved, if not to the point of abstraction, then to delirium: he makes a virtue of incredulity. Starring duo: John Travolta, Christian Slater giving sympathetic but exaggerated interpretations, Travolta's overacting are silly but enjoyable. Travolta generally carries on with the air of a sociopath getting the most out of life. They are well accompanied by a notorious support cast with plenty of familiar faces, such as: Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton, Frank Whaley, Howie Long, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Jack Thompson, Kurtwood Smith, Daniel Von Bergen, Carmen Argenziano, among othersJohn Woo direction is acceptable though with flaws, he moves well the camera with spectacular scenes, but doesn't match with his Hong Kong vehicles (Bullet in the head, The Killer, A better tomorrow I and II), John Woo followed with a successful American career (Hard Target, Broken arrow, Face off, Mission impossible II, Windtalkers). Rating: 5.5/10 . Pity it's quite so silly and embarrassing, but then action enthusiasts can't have everything. The flick will appeal to John Travolta and Christian Slater fans.\n",

            "Review 16: This is a good old fashion action flick from director John Woo, where John Travolta plays corrupted Air Force Major Vic 'Deak' Deakins who intentionally crash lands a U.S. plane holding two nuclear warheads. He demands $250,000,000 from the government in return for the warheads and his co-pilot, Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and U.S. park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) attempt to stop him.This movie has some good direction and a fast-paced plot that kept the story interesting and captivating. The acting was OK for the most part and, from what I remember, there is much edge-of-your-seat excitement seeing Hale pit against Deakins in the warhead mission after he gets beaten by Deakins in a boxing match earlier in the movie. Travolta portrayed a very sneaky and formidable villain and Slater gave a heroic portrayal of the protagonist. Overall, it's a good action flick to pass the time.Grade B\n",

I find Slater to be OK but incredibly bland, the kind of actor who is just there but doesn't add much to the movie in terms of acting or charisma. Travolta on the other hand is overacting and having so much fun being the bad guy I wanted him to kick Slater's ass and ride off into the sunset. Of course this is a typical 80s/90s action movie so the good guy wins and gets the girl but even though Travlolta's character dies he goes out in style. The movie overall is super cheesy and fun, this is what an action movie should be, not the super serious, wannabe realistic schlock we get today. This is balls to the wall fun directed by John Woo who knows how to make a good, fun action flick and make it so corny its laughable but that is the point. Not as good as Hard Target or Face/Off but damn good, solid 7/10.\n",

The only ones who can stop him are his junior officer/co-pilot (Slater), who forms an unlikely team with a reluctant park ranger (Mathis), to try and thwart his diabolical scheme. Woo's one of a kind action scenes make the film worth watching, but they're outweighed by a mediocre script with too many improbabilities and excessive coincidences.

When I first watched it in the 1990s, I found it somewhat insipid in comparison to John Woo's other Hollywood flicks of the 1990s, HARD TARGET and FACE/OFF. I come to it again after a gap of twenty years and to my surprise, BROKEN ARROW is a lot better these days - huge fun, in fact. It's certainly superior to anything that Woo made post-FACE/OFF, and the entertainment value keeps on coming. The film is exceptionally cheesy, over the top and over-directed, but these things help combine to make it fun. Christian Slater is one of the closest US stars that Woo could find who was similar to Chow Yun-Fat in terms of build and movement, and his relationship with Samantha Mathis isn't bad. Woo is absolutely in love with John Travolta and that love affair would continue in FACE/OFF. The film's plot is preposterous, but the story and action is always on the move, and there are two big action set-pieces (the mine and the train) which contain the kind of massive, violent, well-choreographed shoot-out action familiar from Woo's Hong Kong productions. Great stuff!\n",

            "Review 21: Broken Arrow, the lesser known John Woo actioner with John Travolta (Face/Off being the favoured sibling) is an adrenaline blast of pure popcorn movie enchantment. From beginning to end we are treated to pulse pounding fighter jet chases, delightfully cheesy dialogue, bone crunching man to man combat, and endless shootouts bathed in the bloody, nerve shattering glory that only the 90's could deliver. Woo brings his operatic grace out to the desert, and amongst the constant brutish blunt force trauma, his pointed touch is unmistakable. John Travolta gives a loony toons worthy performance that's so far over the top, he shatters the ceiling and blasts off into orbit, grimacing like the joker hijacking an F18. He knows he's in camp territory too, and milks it. He plays Deakins, a jaded lunatic Air Force pilot who absconds with two deadly nuclear warheads, intent on selling them to radicals. Christian Slater is Hale, his second in command, who finds himself on a warpath with Travolta as he chases him through the desert. Woo and team surgically remove any unnecessary, dragging plot lines and distill their process to one simple formula: action. Furious quantities of it too, and indeed Slater finds himself constantly hopping trains, emptying clips into countless paramilitary cannon fodder and taking down helicopters he scarcely finds time to breathe. He gets support in the obligatory female lead, feisty park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis holds her own amongst the boys splendidly). Woo is an action maestro, and he unleashes a hell storm of beautifully staged set pieces and delirious fight scenes for fans of the genre to bask in. Accompanied by Hans Zimmer's thunderous, effortlessly cool score, it's a real treat. Supporting our three leads are Kurtwood Smith, Chris Mulkey, Bob Gunton, Frank Whaley, Howie Long, Delroy Lindo and Daniel Von Bargen filling out the respective genre archetypes that we love to see. It doesn't have the 007 esque class or panache of Face/Off, but it has plenty of sound and fury to slake anyone's lust for gaudy, excessively enjoyable slash and burn action that's off the rails.\n",

            "Review 22: Broken Arrow is one of my favorite movies and perhaps one of the most underrated movies ever.It feature a lot going for it, Good cast, good plot and very good directing.The plot of Broken Arrow centers around two pilots Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slate) and Major Vic 'Deak' Deakins (John Travolta) are order to fly a B-3 Bomber carrying two live nuclear warheads however Deakins ends up betraying Hale and is working a deal to sell the stolen nuclear warheads.He eject Hale from the plane and meets with his team to sell the nukes.However Hale survives the attack and begins working with Park Ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) and it is up to them to put a stop to Deakins and his men before it is too late.Director John Woo did a really good job with the camera angles for the action scenes and knew exactly what to do at the right moment.The Action scenes in this film are very good it goes to show the 90s were good to action films. The Scene where the plane fly over Terry and she falls backward the shot was very well done. My personal favorite scene in this movie is when Hale and Terry first meet and they get into a fight that scene was set up just right and they end up joining forces.There are a lot of tense moments in the film and you will be wondering what would happen nextPlus the writing for the film has some smart one liners and they actually made the story and characters enjoyable. John makes a twisted villain, Samantha does pretty well in this film and Christian shows how well he could do given the right people.The score in the film matches the story and action in the film's final fight it really shows. The Stunts are very good as well and it just goes to show that the film does what it can. Plus the creative work that went into the action scenes is smart.Plus the climax of the film is balance really well. Broken Arrow just does a lot to make it a worthy film in the action series and it should get more creditWith a good story, good action scenes and John Woo directing it should be right up there with the best films of the 90s I give Broken Arrow an 8 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 23: John Woo, after his many Hong Kong efforts, came to America and made Hard Target (1993), which due to studio interference and bad taking of direction by Jean Claude Van Damme, wasn't as good as it could have been. Woo got a bad reputation due to his conflicts with both the MPAA and Universal, and it took him awhile to get this one off of the ground. Woo had never worked with special effects, so he was treading into new territory. Luckily, he got two great leads, Christian Slater (soon to be in Windtalkers), and John Travolta (Face/Off). They take his direction well, and each gives a good performance. As the traditional villain's henchman, which I like to call Indestructable Villain Sidekick, Howie Long gives a good performance, and dies a good death too. I never appreciated this movie that much until watching it tonight, and I realized, this is probably the most action-packed movie in a long time. It takes only about 6 minutes to get going, and then, boom! boom! boom! Action sequence after the other, no let-down in between. This movie has plently of shootouts, explosions, and great innovative twists (kicking the rear blade of a helicopter to knock a gun out of one's hand) to make a action movie good. John Woo's cinematography, the great shared moments (the 20 dollar bill and whatnot) are what makes this one a great action movie. Another thing that makes this flick great is that it gave Woo the power to get Face/Off, his best Hollywood outing, the greenlight. I'm looking forward to Windtalkers and love all of Woo's movies.9 outta 10.\n",

            "Review 24: Broken Arrow is your typical John Woo movie because it does deliver the thrills. As John Woo's first big budget film, he does a decent job. While the story may not be consistent and the film seems to be a little overlong, there is plenty of action and explosions to keep action junkies happy. Given the fact that there are two big stars to carry the film, it's not a bad film at all.John Woo's film is about two bombers named Hal and Deakins who are stealth bombers and are assigned to an exercise that features live nuclear weapons. But the weapons are eventually stolen by a surprising turn of events and that may cause some serious trouble if weapons are not found.Christian Slater and John Travolta are the two main stars of the film and they do a solid job. I sometimes find it hard to see Travolta as a baddie and he does well overall. But, I can't help mention that there is this cheesy scene when we first discover he is indeed the bad guy. Slater does really good and he is the guy we love to root for.Overall, this is a good movie that certainly doesn't back down on the action. In fact, the final forty minutes of the film is just action. But being a Woo film, the action is wonderfully staged and often engaging. A weak-ish story does not really hinder this film all too much. I rate this film 8/10.\n",
